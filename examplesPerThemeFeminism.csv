0,Dating / Flirting,"Ex1: dating while feminist i am a  number  y . o . cis - woman and i really am struggling to date right now . i think i have dated  number  or  number  true feminists in my life . but the bar seems to be so low . i am part of a cabal of fierce women who support each other and invest their time and emotions into fighting for justice . these women astound me and when i look at the men in my life , they may be nice decent people , but they do not impress me the way my female friends do . i know no one is perfect , but the man i recently broke up with called himself a feminist but made negative comments about homeless people and was pretty juvenile about sex . i did not want to date someone with those values for personal reasons , but i also felt like i was .   betraying other women if i tolerated that behavior . something i really want for myself is marriage ( or some type of union ) and kids . but .   i am becoming so disheartened . i know that as a white , cis - gendered woman i probably have an easier time dating than others which also saddens me . anyway , i just wanted to see what single people thought about how to date as a feminist .
Ex2: response to article "" why i will never date a feminist "" that came out last week my friend was deeply aggravated by the misguided views of feminism that that post [ why i will never date a feminist ] (   spewed , so she wrote a response . i will link it here if you are interested ! she ' s quite sassy ! [ let me woman - splain feminism to you ] (   x - post from twoxchromosomes edit : linking error
Ex3: independent women who are single and dating ( question ) the women ' s role when it comes to dating does not seem to have changed much since , well , ever . i agree that women are more independent now than ever before and there is definitely still more progress needed to make things equal . from what i have experienced , ( i am a  number  year old male ) the idea that the man is supposed to engage the female , when it comes to the initial "" hey i like you , wanna go on a date "" thing is still very strong . i do not want to offend anybody , especially half of the entire human population , but if women are to become independent , should not all roles be equally shared ? a really good example is online dating . the difference between the number of initial messages sent by males vs those sent by females is big , too big . i do not have numbers , i am basing this off of experience . ( i searched the internet , well google , and there were no actual answers i could find ) if a woman meets a man and she finds him intriguing , would not it make things better for her if she felt more comfortable officially expressing her feelings ? she would have a better chance of getting to know men who actually interest her .

1,Self Esteem / Grooming,"Ex1: why are the hijab and niquab suddenly being presented as liberating or feminist symbols ? i can not remember who made this comparison , but as a middle eastern guy , i found this extremely true : saying the hijab liberates women and is a symbol of feminism is like a woman in the 1 9 3 0 s saying that staying at home without a job , raising her kids , and not going out without her husbands permission are feminist symbols and are liberating . it is very nice that her desires happen to fit with the status quo , but at the core , it is false . the hijab just perpetuates rape culture . the whole religious justification for it is that men cannot control themselves and women must cover themselves to compensate , a concept which is the antithesis of modern feminism . and it does not even work ! the fact that when my sister visits my place in egypt , she ' s too afraid to walk to the gym two minutes away without me accompanying her because men will chase her with cars and constantly harass her is a direct result of this mentality that is perpetuated by the hijab . obviously i am not saying that women * should not * wear the hijab . it should always be a woman ' s choice to wear what she wants . but when publications like the huffington post and western women start claiming that the veil liberates women and should be considered feminist symbol , it is an insult to all the women in the middle east and southeast asia who have been convinced that their bodies are too tempting for men to handle , and that rape prevention should be their responsibility . edit : for those who may think that i am in a place which is affected more by sexual harassment and rape most other places in the middle east ; i live in an upper - middle class neighborhood . this is a safer and more liberal area than most .
Ex2: if you do not wear heels your fired yes , the title is true . so i am a hair dresser in a big city . i am afraid to say where . i worked for the "" colourist of loreal paris "" for four years . i believed he would help my career . instead , after four years of working for him he randomly decided that i had to wear  number  inch heels ( as a minimum ) dress like a stripper , and that i had to lose  number  lbs . he use to treat me like a personal assistant and i would have to buy him condoms , lube , and illegal poppers . ( he was gay but hated lesbians . how the fuck does that make sense ) when i met him , i weighed  number  lbs , at the height of an eating disorder . after counselling and peer group help , i got over it and gained a nice  number  lbs . he got very mad . he called me fat at any chance . he also tried to make me wear heels when he knew i had s foot disorder where my feet were overturned . he loved to remind me that i had a very beautiful face but an ugly body . years later , he said heels or get the fuck out , i said i refuse to wear the heels until you provide a shock abosorbncy matt , he said no i am not spending the money on that , i said i am not wearing heels , and long story short he said i was fired . i know i have a case to fight with , but i can not give up my reputation in the hair world , please help .
Ex3: swimsuits - men vs women for my work i was told i needed to wear a one piece suit for a trip or else i needed to wear a t - shirt . i asked if i could wear my tankini with high waisted shorts to make sure my stomach did not show , and they still said to bring a t - shirt . why are men ' s abs not sexualized ?   if one strip of my stomach shows apparently the male population is going to get raging boners and not be able to control themselves . so frustrating .
Ex4: developing my ‘ femme ’ self without shame so , i ’ ve been a lesbian all my life since , i ’ m now  number  , but i ’ ve also been a feminist and much more radical ( not letting men or women get away with misogynistic language ) as i ’ ve gotten older , and i ’ ve been doing a lot of soul searching . in my youth , i was what is now called a lipstick femme , and i was happy ; then i got fat , got a job that is traditionally male , and forced to wear male fitted clothes for work uniform , and a few other things ( loss of self - esteem , loss of sexual relationships ) all conspired to put me in a position where i robbed myself of my own femininity . i ’ ve been seeing a counsellor and as part of that , a thread came up ; that i should re - discover and develop my femininity again , as surprising that has made me a fractured person . i ’ m writing here to ask for help and advice . how do i try and do this with all the body / beauty shame i have ? i feel ugly , i know i ’ m morbidly obese , and it “ feels ’ like trying to be the lipstick lesbian i once was is part of a mid / late life crisis and not attainable , but the arguments we ’ ve had in sessions show that she is who i am and how i want to feel , so after  number  years of not wearing makeup , how do i ‘ transition ’ without feeling uncomfortable or shame ? maybe this should be a cross post in feminism too , but i ’ m asking my lesbian sisters for some help . thanks for reading .

2,Relationships,"-

------------------------------

Ex1: a conversation i had with my friends brother to start off , my friend moved out for school and he took her room but took off all her decorations . she had paper butterflies that she made and put them up on the wall , which he took down . we asked him why and said he did not want a girly   room . me : .   how are butterflies girly ? .   him : they just are , i mean it ' s literally in the name . me : butter - fly .   him : i mean just look at their wings , they are all girly and pretty and .   and then he begins to just stutter realizing how dumb he sounded . how insecure can one be to the point where they are emasculated by a bug . the male ego is so fragile .
Ex2: how do i deal with a sexist friend ? i am a male , and have been an advocate for women ' s rights , but one of my friends is extremely sexist ( and slightly racist ) . he has been a friend of mine for a while and i agree with him on many other issues ( if that is the correct terminology ) . what can i do to talk with him about women ' s rights without "" just walk away from it "" ?
Ex3: just found out that my friend has assaulted women hello , i have not been here before but i need to order my thinking . yesterday i found out via a whisper network that a man i am friends with has assaulted various women . i did not hear the accounts straight from our shared acquaintances , but from a concerned source who knows i have a personal and to some extent professional relationship with the man in question . the whole thing has thrown me and i am stuck because i am not sure how to deal with this at all . i have a fair idea of which women it may concern and of course i believe them , i am just struggling as i consider him a good friend . part of me wants to challenge him , but feel this might be unfair to the unnamed parties who are understandably trying to find a way to deal with it - the whisper network exists for a reason . i also do not want to talk to him * at all * , as i am shocked and horrified - especially as his whole personal brand is all about how ' woke ' he is . i am just so confused and upset and do not know how to react or feel .

3,Gendered Movements,"Ex1: what is your view of feminism in politics . i have heard a lot about feminism affecting how woman vote . is vetoing for hilliary over sanders because she ' s a woman feminism or is being biased in the wrong direction . additionally i have also heard that voting for sanders is the correct option as not to appear biased by siding with the fellow woman . i have heard so many contradictory views and wanted to see what others thought ?  
Ex2: learn about feminism - good intro articles / tv shows / documentaries ? hi all ! looking for some resources ! my new - ish partner is somewhat new to this topic but open , progressive and curious especially as he knows it ' s important to me . we have talked about many topics within feminism but i am struggling to go back to basics sometimes ( not to say this condescendingly at all ! lol ) i ' d like to share some articles , tv shows , documentaries , etc . with him as he ' s not much into reading books . any good intro material that people found helpful when they were first learning ( i am thinking intro to what feminism is , rape culture , consent , transgender , gender queer , etc . ) ? thank you everyone !  happy 
Ex3: feminism a marketing trend ? at a bookstore event , i met a young man i will call joe and had a friendly chat with him . i described the novel i am writing about a woman working in a place where only men were allowed to be customers . joe said , "" i am a feminist . feminism is hot right now . you can use that to market and sell your books . "" questions : is it feminist , misogynistic , or logical to describe feminism as a marketing technique ? is a man a feminist when says he ' s a feminist and then talks about feminism as a marketing trend ?
Ex4: virginia woolf and modern feminism throughout a room of one ' s own , woolf describes the corrosive effects of anger - in herself , in the men who write about women , and especially , in other women writers . today , many feminists embrace anger as a legitimate emotional reaction to an unjust and sexist world , and seek to overturn traditional gender roles that regard anger as "" unfeminine "" . explain woolf ' s view and assess it in relation to this tendency in modern feminism . has woolf underestimated the value of righteous anger and other emotions ? i am just trying to get a general consensus of what people think in relation to this statement .

------------------------------

Ex1: sexism in school i have heard about a teacher who teaches biology in the eighth - grade . she asked the students to tell her what is typical girlish and what is typical boyish . and she really wrote stuff like : girls cook and clean while boys do not . and that only girls make up and this is so obvious so she did not write it down . what would you do ? i thought about writing an email to the principal . i saw the note of one of her students so i would call it verified .
Ex2: jameis winston again ( speech to kids ) i do not have the full speech but here ' s an article :   “ all my young boys , stand up . the ladies , sit down , ” he said . “ but all my boys , stand up . we strong , right ? we strong ! we strong , right ? all my boys , tell me one time : i can do anything i put my mind to . now a lot of boys aren ’ t supposed to be soft - spoken . you know what i ’ m saying ? one day y ’ all are going to have a very deep voice like this ( in deep voice ) . one day , you ’ ll have a very , very deep voice . “ but the ladies , they ’ re supposed to be silent , polite , gentle . my men , my men ( are ) supposed to be strong . i want y ’ all to tell me what the third rule of life is : i can do anything i put my mind to . scream it ! ”
Ex3:   bs ece   in may : grad proposal for electrical engineering ( women in   stem   figured you could share similar experiences ) "" too often the great decisions are originated and given form in bodies made up wholly of men , or so completely dominated by them that whatever of special value women has to offer is shunted aside without expression . "" - eleanor roosevelt my dad pushed me into engineering school ; it wasn ' t a major i contemplated until he told me he knew i would be successful at it . looking back at my senior year in high school and making one of the largest decisions in my life , i am appalled at the lack of mentors and teachers that mentioned engineering as a career path and when i walked into my first day of classes in electrical engineering i knew why : there were only about two other women in any of my major classes . i had never felt so out of place in my life and began to second guess if i was really in the right field . i thought of changing my major to accounting , math , nursing or even a different engineering principle with more women . along with developing this feeling of not belonging , i felt this need to prove myself to every other male student because i believed that being equally smart would not suffice . i needed to be better so that noone could ever doubt my intelligence in comparison to everyone else around me . this ultimately created my perfectionist persona with unrealistic goals and extreme anxiety . if i failed at anything or did not receive the highest grade , i became paranoid it would be equated with me not belonging in engineering school and this feeling was reinforced by my lack of confidence that i belonged there to begin with . though i still occasionally compare myself to others who i deem as intellectuals , i ended up with a selectgroup of classmates who i truly view me as equal in all aspects . i have learned to push away the feelings of insecurity and quiet the voices that tell me i do not belong in a male dominated field . my purpose of going into graduate school is to not only specialize in my major , but also to influence young girls to pursue their dreams . i am exceptionally interested in signal processing and acoustics . signal processing sparked my interest junior year and acoustics my senior year . first because i understood the material , but second because the way sound travels and can be modeled amazes me . i would like to continue to learn more about one or both of these subjects because the undergraduate material was a general overview and i hope to see the expansion of these material in future master level classes . along with wanting to specialize in electrical engineering , in the future i would love to be a mentor and give talks to young women about pursuing   stem   majors . my master ' s degree opens doors for me that would allow me to help young girls either by getting a doctorate and teaching or just going to schools and talking to women about careers and options that they may not have considered before .
Ex4: what sexist behavior or statements have   your   school teachers made through your school career ? i have got a story .   this happened in my ninth grade english class . it was an honors class keep in mind where everyone was academically driven for success . on the first day of school , our teacher was going through all the normal stuff you know , class expectations , course outline , until things took a turn for the worst when she began explaining the school lockdown procedure . so this is how it worked , we would all get in the corner of the room in the case of an emergency , farthest away from the door so no intruders could see in . however , not all  number  of us could fit in the given corner without some of us being seen . this is not the teachers fault by any means , it just means that in the very slim chance that something bad was to happen , some will be more at risk than others . she then explained that the formation of how we will be situated will be based on gender . the girls would be in the farthest of the corner , where they would be shielded by the boys who would be put as a barrier of protection between them and the entrance . so where does that leave the people who are inevitably seen from the doorway ? means that only boys would been seen . in the case of an emergency , she instructed the boys to pick up a form of some weapon , only the boys . her justification for this ? to protect the girls and to wield it against a intruder . not to mention putting the boys at risk of being shot up due to the fact that we could possibly be rummaging around for a weapon to use as an intruder enters through the door . at this point , many of us were simply laughing at how stupid this actually is . like cmon this in my opinion is just more plain ol ' stupid than sexist . when one of my male peers asked why is it like this , her response was that he should not have any problem with it being that since he is a male he should have the strength and ability to fend off a possible school shooter and females like herself should be happy that this tactical system is in place , but girls included were not buying it one bit . needless to say , this system was not used during the school year due to its constant stupidity . now that this story has been given , what other ignorant situations have you been apart of during your school career ? &  hashtag  x 200 b   ;

Ex1: so .   is reddit generally anti - feminist ? in an r / askreddit thread , i made the mistake of implying that patriarchy exists , *( shock horror ! )* and that its values can have negative effects for men as well as women . ( e . g . motherhood is a woman ' s ' natural role ' therefore men are at a disadvantage i am custody battles ) . people seemed to get quite pissed off about it and assume that i hate all men .   which was certainly not what i wanted to convey . i explained my point roughly as i did above . it ' s not something that i am upset about . explained myself calmly and rationally and even made light of the situation . so is my experience unique ? do you guys find larger subs like askreddit jump on feminist - leaning comments with a lot of vitriol without seeming to actually address your point ? maybe i live in a liberal bubble but i was quite surprised to the reaction to what i considered an innocuous comment . sorry if this post is inappropriately placed here . i have read the rules and i think it should be ok .
Ex2: why is most of reddit afraid of feminism ? every time i mention it or stand up to someone making fun of feminism or being a blatant misogynist , i get immediately attacked by multiple people in the thread . like they are all afraid of it or want to deny it exists . it seems to me all the people that have something to say about feminism are men . why ' s that ? there ' s never any women as far as i can tell by usernames that tell me i am wrong doing , etc . this has been bugging me for awhile . any ideas ? edit : thanks for all your opinions . considering them all i have a better understanding , or on some , * do not * , of why this topic is disclosed so greatly and so often . sorry i can not reply to everyone .
Ex3: how do you feel about lesbians putting down men ? i used to belong to this sub , which recently allowed a thread called "" men are annoying "" . although i am a feminist , i try to stay objectively equal , and i do not agree that we should be putting down the entire male gender . here ' s the link to the thread :   some excerpts : "" i am hating men more and more everyday , they are annoying as fuck . "" "" after listening to men all day at work , i am ready for the first ticket out of here . "" "" the only men i love are my nephews . all the other men are just stupid and gross . "" keep in mind , this sub is supposedly extremely harsh with anyone who even hovers around intolerance . they will ban anyone who comes close to transphobia or sexism towards women . i just think it makes me feel awful as a lesbian that the most popular lesbian sub on reddit is allowing this kind of discussion . what if we substituted "" men "" with "" women "" ? i ' d be furious ! seems pretty intolerant to me . just wondering if you guys support this kind of talk and i am alone in thinking this is wrong . thanks .

Ex1: credible feminist youtubers i am a  number  y / o male who would not identify as a feminist , i would not go as far to say i am anti - feminist , but i am definitely unsure about the movement . i see a lot of "" feminist fail videos "" and such , with radical feminists who are an absolute extreme and who i am sure do not accurately represent feminists . i feel that because i see a lot of this type of video , i can not make a full decision on feminism until i see the other side properly . so my question is , who are some good feminist youtubers who may more accurately represent feminism , and who would be good for me to learn more about the movement .
Ex2: request : looking for a link to a feminist video about women being geeks and about inclusion in geek culture i vaguely recall seeing this a long time ago and can not seem to find it now . the actual video had different women holding signs saying that they are geeks with their various geek hobbies . it ' s a great video / song and i want to share it with a friend but can not find it , so i hope someone here will recognize and was smart enough to save a link to it . thanks in advance !

------------------------------

Ex1: new feminist literary society in savannah ! hi , i just started a new chapter of the feminist literary society in savannah , ga ( the main chapter is in chicago ) , which will meet for discussion once a month . if you are interested check out the fb group   ( hopefully that link works , if not shoot me a message ! ) if you are in the area i ' d love for you to join . it ' s a private group so i will have to approve your request to join . i look forward to hopefully meeting some fellow feminists !
Ex2: there ' s this field trip at my kid ' s b& g club . apparently there is a "" girl power "" club at the local boys & girls club where my kid goes . i do not know what this group does in club because this is the first i am hearing about it , but they have invited my kid to a field trip on monday , to a nail salon for manicures . i have nothing against manicures . the child can have all the nail polish she wants . i just feel like there are a ton of things that could be done to empower young folk , why are we sending kids on a field trip for manicures ? so , i guess first off , am i overreacting ? second , what would you do ?
Ex3: do organizations like   now   represent modern demographics in feminism ? occasionally when i see someone complaining about feminism , they will talk about how organizations like   now   will campaign against mens - rights groups , and it got me thinking . from what i see in the media , most activism seems to moving away from large , monolithic national organizations in for of a decentralized style , with no formal leadership structure , and of large numbers of local groups under the same umbrella . an example would be the   blm   movement . is the same trend occurring in feminist activism ? are organizations like   now   more populated by older people than younger ? are organizations like   now   still relevant in modern feminist discourse ?

------------------------------

Ex1: danger me and my daughter moved to an unexpectedly horrifying small city . we are enduring one blow after another , and being stalked by more than three creepy men . i am very scared for my beautiful daughter , and am trying to create a quick online presence to document my worries . we live in pueblo colorado .
Ex2: how can a daughter explain a mother , who firmly believes into men / women inequalities , that her jokes and remarks that stick an image to each sex are not funny ? the daughter is  number  years old . she gets remarks on how to dress and behave properly . she has to lie , pretending she has no friends of the other sex . every complaint on a joke or a remark immediately starts a dispute . god plays a role in the justification of the inequalities . a women has a "" duty "" as a woman toward god . she has to be sweet and charming , attentive , to not laugh too much with men , etc . and attacking the god argument means blasphemy . the situation goes beyond jokes and remarks , but having them stopped would reduce the pressure . the situation goes beyond men / women inequalities , but i try to keep it relevant to this subreddit ( i will move this thread if it should be posted elsewhere ) . i can try to give more details if needed . - - - - - - - i am not the daughter in question . i am the usual suspect , the white cis male . i deeply believe that doing this on her behalf is fundamentaly wrong ; it would be better to have her ask for help ( here or anywhere ) , and explain the situation with her own words and knowledge of the situation . at first , i told her that she could to this to get some help , but for various reasons she refused . i do have her agreement to post this , and i will give her a link to this thread .
Ex3: what are your thoughts on equal rights in terms of raising a child from birth while separated ? it seems as though society is based on the notion that mothers are natural born nurturers and that the attatchment to the mother is priority over a bond with the father . in most cases a child born with separated parents , the father is to pay full amounts of child support and only allowed "" access "" in some cases until the child is  number  years old without discussion of custody or overnight stays . how , in any way does this affect the view point of the certain roles of women and men in society as equals in regards to raising a child and the importance of each gender , with men essentially at first being seen as a provider of financial support solely with limited access to a child ' s life legally and of course including the phsycological effects for the development of the wellbeing of the child . is there any contradictions to equality as far as how society is set up currently in this view point ? assuming the father is on board and prepared to care for that child in any way possible .
Ex4: my father the feminist : i ’ m a teenage girl , who is will graduate high school this year . since i ’ m beginning the big transition of “ leaving the nest ” , i ’ ve spent a lot of my time reflecting on the person that i ’ ve become . and how my father is very much a big hero of mine . my father considers himself a “ feminist ” of sorts . and he has instilled quite a bit of confidence in me over the years . for a long time i was ashamed to be female . people would jokingly tell my i was going to be “ the first woman president ” when i expressed my passion for politics . but i didn ’ t want that . i wanted to be judged by my qualifications , not my gender . my father has given me fascinating perspective . he often corrects me when i apologize for speaking up or being shy if i ’ m the only girl in a group . “ you shouldn ’ t have to apologize for having an opinion or being who you are . ” he says , “ that ’ s a rampant problem that women have to face . i want you to be more than that , because i believe you can be . ” he never has installed gender roles into me . on the one hand , i love makeup and gossiping about boys , and on the other i love playing video games and football . my father makes me forget that i ’ m a woman in a male - dominated world . he makes me proud to be myself , my gender aside . my father is how i feel about feminism . we shouldn ’ t even think about a person ’ s gender when we judge their character . we shouldn ’ t patronize women or focus on them simply because they ’ re women . we should just accept them for who they are , and cultivate their passions . haha rant over . the point is , i love my father  happy 
Ex5: what do you all think about father / daughter dates ? i ’ ve seen some posts on reddit and even from some facebook friends about fathers who take their daughters on “ dates ” where they have one - on - one time , get all dressed up , and go dancing somewhere ( or movies , or something else pretty close to what an actual date is ) . typically the daughters are between  number  and  number  years of age . i think the idea is to have their daughters understand what respectful men are like and to have time to bond with their fathers . well , something about it really rubs me the wrong way , but i can ’ t quite articulate why . can you please share your thoughts about this practice , the intentions behind it , whether you do this ( or would do this ) with your own family , etc ? i ’ d like to hear so i can better understand my own thoughts on it .   tia

Ex1: which women have the most inspirational stories , ever . i am collecting stories about contemporary women who are inspiring , for an alexa app i built . the goal is to tell stories of inspiring women , in order to remind men , women , boys and girls alike that many of the great contributions , inventions , initiatives , and movements we have in the world , are because of the incredible women who created them . so far , i use lists i found online like from time , fortune and the like . but there are many categories - business , sports , art , politics , and i do not know what to focus on . is it better to focus on famous women , or unknown women ? inventors ? scientists ? what would be most inspirational ? directing me to resources , lists , ideas would be great .
Ex2: share your story hello women of reddit ! i am in the process of creating a website called female rising . the website will be a place where women who have trauma from any situation ranging from harassment to assault to abuse can share their stories anonymously or not and read other womens stories . they will also have access to a group discussion forum where they can talk to others who understand how they feel and can talk about what they are dealing with and how they are coping and possibly make new friends ( the forum will be moderated and rude comments will be blocked ) . there will be provided links to professional help options . the whole website will be completely costless and safe from hate . before i have the website go live to those that i do not share the link with , i need stories already published on the site . so if you or a friend or family member of yours has a story to get off their chest please encourage them to send their story to  email  . in the email , please specify if you would prefer to remain anonymous or not . if not , write your first name , age , and state along with your story . comments are enabled so also specify if you want comments turned off for your story . horrible people get away with horrible things because they count on us keeping our mouths shut . using your voice not only helps yourself to feel better , it spreads awareness and helps others know they are not alone . [ female rising ] (  
Ex3: help ! i am writing a curriculum to teach feminism to teenage boys . i need help writing a fictional conversation or story that shows objectifying language and attitudes . submit a few lines in the comments ? i am writing a curriculum to teach feminism to teenage boys . i need help writing a fictional conversation or story that shows objectifying language and attitudes . the story / conversation will be read to groups of about  number  high school aged guys . they will try to point out all the places where there is sexism or objectification . can you contribute a few sentences or phrases that you think teenage boys should recognize as objectifying ? or , if you are into creative writing , maybe you could write a  number  -  number  paragraph story ?

Ex1: the women ' s march in montreal - my experience wow ! yesterday was .   phenomenal , historical , herstorical , powerful , touching , rejuvenating and wonderful in so many ways . i may not live in the us , but the women ' s march was important for every single person and i am so proud to have marched alongside fellow supported in the montreal branch of the woman ' s march . i have a few thoughts and i snapped a few photos that you can find [ on my site here ] (   i would love to read other blog posts that people may have written about their experiences . thank you in advance for sharing your stories .
Ex2: how can the women ' s march supporters justify having donna hylton speak ? a woman who was convicted of kidnapping and torturing a homosexual man who was starved , burned , beaten , and tortured over a period of  number  -  number    days   was invited to speak ? !   i am no trump fan and there are plenty of issues women and really everyone legitimately have with him but how any group could knowingly invite someone who has done what this woman did is beyond me .
Ex3: women ' s march what went wrong communication - wise ? the women ' s march was a big success , more people went to washington to be involved in it than the inauguration of president trump , but i can not help feel like it could have been even bigger and reached even more folks . this is probably only because i feel a bit left out myself . i do not log into this subreddit every day , but it ' s one i subscribe to , so it does show in my front page feed , but so do dozens of others , so not every story comes through , and i do not think that ' s out of the ordinary . personally i did not see mention of the march until mid - week the week before it happened . i did not realize that there were local events all over until mid - morning the day of . i caught on to that because a ( male ) friend of mine went to an event local to him and live - streamed it to facebook . i am not a diehard who buries myself in feminist media , but i think i am kind of sort of keeping myself in the loop as best i can manage .   so i started to wonder why , if the womensmarch . com website went up in november , did i not start seeing anytihing about it until just a few days before it happened . one of the first mentions i saw was a news story about a group of canadian women being turned away at the border who had wanted to join in the dc march . when i did a google news search for refences to "" womensmarch . com "" i was unable to find much mention of it before  date  . .   so what went wrong ? why is it that i , and probably lots of others who would have at least considered joining a local march did not hear about it a lot sooner ? obviously from what i have seen in the media , the word got out to university feminist groups and   lgbtqia   groups , but i do not feel word reached a lot of others until very late . i am not criticizing , just hoping that if i put the question out there this movement and others like it will benefit from any follow up dialog .

4,Health / Abuse,"Ex1: the problem with rape ' jokes ' .   is explaining that they perpetuate and validate rape culture , positioning rape as ' no big deal ' . this seems so basic and simple for a human to understand that i just have a blue screen error in my head when i [ have to explain to someone ] (   that it ' s not funny . i know that when someone in the invisible , unquestioned , majority is asked to look at their complicity around violence and marginalization , the results usually are not pretty . i am just curious how others handle these interactions . it can be really tough to try to draw boundaries and educate others in a constructive way , especially when you are painted like a crazy person for pointing out that sexual assault is not humorous . hearing some success stories would really be appreciated .
Ex2: i was raped a year ago . sign this petition . please sign this petition to hold my prior university accountable for their actions . over a year has passed and they still have done nothing . i am hoping to get this circulating again so that it can be sent to the university ! please sign , share , anything to get this out again . thank you !  
Ex3: how come people say there is no rape culture when porn is mostly rape ? so i like hentai ( mostly in manga ) and watch porn . however all of this is getting frustrating because  percent  ( eventhough i check the tags for vanilla and cons ) majority of what i find ends up being rape - to which the one raped ends up liking it - like what the fuck ? i wonder if it is me looking in the wrong places or what . plus , in real life porn guys often have huge penis ( scary ) and the female actriz is dry during majority of it ( jesus christ o . o ) and on top of that some of the moans really sound just like she is trying to hide the pain ( this last point my boyfriend did not notice until i pointed out ) . so , how come there is no rape culture if this is what you get with vanilla and cons tags ? am i extrapolating too far ?

Ex1: how university administrators combat sexual assault ( for research paper ) i am doing a research essay on college sexual assault , and i am wondering if anyone has stories they are willing to share or experiences with the administrations at universities and how they have successfully or unsuccessfully educated about , prevented , investigated , and adjudicated sexual violence on their campuses . i have been particularly impressed by janet napolitano and her leadership with the issue at the university of california . please reply if you have experiences or advice to add or know of other colleges that have created effective plans for dealing with sexual violence * * *   disclaimer   * * * i understand that this is a very private issue , so myself and the moderator encourage you to respond privately . i personally can assure you no details about you ( username , name , school , etc ) will be shared with anyone else . this is completely confidential and you can remain anonymous . i will not cite individuals , i hope to just gather a range of stories that can shed light on how effective the strategies are that colleges and universities are using .
Ex2: sexual assault awareness and protection month sexual assault awareness month (   saam   ) is an annual campaign to raise public awareness about sexual assault and educate communities and individuals on how to prevent sexual violence . it is observed in april . each year during the month of april , state , territory , tribal and community - based organizations , rape crisis centers , government agencies , businesses , campuses and individuals plan events and activities to highlight sexual violence as a public health , human rights and social justice issue and reinforce the need for prevention efforts . the theme , slogan , resources and materials for the national   saam   campaign are coordinated by the national sexual violence resource center each year with assistance from anti - sexual assault organizations throughout the united states . * * * * history   * as early as  number  , take back the night marches rallied women in organized protest rape and sexual assault . these marches protested the violence and fear that women encountered walking the streets at night . over time these events coordinated into a movement across the united states and europe . because of this movement broader activities to raise awareness of violence against women began to occur . in the late 1 9 8 0 s , the national coalition against sexual assault (   ncasa   ) informally polled state sexual assault coalitions to determine the preferred date for a national sexual assault awareness week . a week in april was selected . by the late 1 9 9 0 s , many advocates began coordinating activities and events throughout the month of april , advancing the idea of a nationally recognized month for sexual violence awareness and prevention activities .   saam   was first observed nationally in  date  . in  number  , president obama was the first united states president to proclaim april as sexual assault awareness month . april is also sexually transmitted disease awareness month in the united states , started in  number  to promote education about stds and prevention .

Ex3: struggling after sexual violence hi everyone , i am totally new to reddit and i honestly just came here because i am looking for some support and advice . i apologize in advance for the long explanation : i was in a relationship that lasted about four years . he was my high school sweetheart . long story short , i ended things with him last fall after finding out that he cheated on me , had hundreds of nudes of other women and sexually assaulted someone his freshman year of college . as you can imagine , this was the most crushing thing i have ever experienced . since last summer , i have been struggling on and off with depression and anxiety , and through therapy , i realized that a lot , if not most , of the sexual experiences i had with this person were violent and nonconsensual . he would choke me a lot during sex without asking — at one point , we were drunk and i was convinced he was going to kill me with how hard he was choking me . i will never forget the tears streaming down my face and my vision starting to blur as his hands were around my neck . there were a lot of other instances of sexual violence in our relationship , like forcing anal upon me multiple times , pinning my arms and legs down and covering my mouth as he did things to me that i did not want to happen . but since he was my boyfriend all those years , and the first person i was ever that intimate with , i always excused everything that happened to me . over and over . i thought it was normal for him to be "" rough "" with me , and the depressed side of me sometimes welcomed the pain , as i often held a self - harming attitude . it ' s fucked up , i know , and i feel guilty about it all the time . i do not really know why i am here , but i have been struggling a lot lately recounting these memories . it ' s weird because during the relationship i never had this type of reaction to what was happening to me , but now , as i look back on it , it ' s the most painful thing for me to think about . i am currently in a very healthy , safe , loving relationship with a wonderful guy , but i always feel bad for bringing these memories up with him . i can not seem to get over the violent things that happened with my ex , and i usually feel bad for having negative mental reactions to what happened since it was within my own relationship . i feel like anyone would think i am crazy for letting myself stay with someone like that for all those years , so i always feel guilty for considering myself a survivor of any sort . i guess i am just looking for some outside perspectives on this and find some clarity on what i am going through . is it right for me to even feel this way ? would this be considered sexual assault ? intimate partner violence ? i feel so bad and ashamed about it all , and i do not really know what to do . sorry if this is not very eloquent — it ' s hard to formulate all these feelings into words . any help is appreciated .

Ex1: sarah paulson on hollywood ' s racism to women   she mentioned that casting directors only considered her a romantic leading lady if she colored her hair blonde . if that ' s what they do to a lot of white actresses , can u imagine how much worse it is for nonwhite , brown skinned latin actresses , black actresses , asian actresses , native american actresses , etc ? they may say they are liberal , but hollywood is full of racists . here ' s hoping sarah wins an emmy as marcia clark .
Ex2: we have to listen to our black sisters   it ' s not enough to educate ourselves on these issues ( although that is a major step ) . we have to listen , organize , and stand with african american woman at all times . as well as recognize our privilege being european american woman a . k . a . white .
Ex3: white person wanting to better understand struggles   poc   have in modern day - where to start catching up on history ? books , movies , personal experience , etc . hi , long time lurker , first time posting , so i hope this is right . i grew up in a very multi cultural area . because of this , i always saw people as people , not their race . i used to think this was a good thing until i moved to a very white are with few   poc   and realized how ignorant i was to white privilege in general . my old town - white privilege wasn ' t a "" thing "" because there was no race ' larger ' than the other and equal ethnic groups owned local businesses and were the doctors & other important people . now , since all i see is white people , i realize the "" accidental racism "" everywhere like shoes that are called "" nude "" , few to none   poc   on radio , tv , positions of authority in the rest of the world ( the western world , that is ) . the moment that made me check my privilege was that nikki minaj / taylor swift thing on twitter when nikki calked out   mtv   for not acknowledging   poc   . i initially thought her comments were a dig at swift , even before swift replied to her . in the coming days i realized i was even more ignorant than i thought because i missed her point about race issues completely until other media explained it . i did not realize how much of feminism is white feminism and does not include poc or   lgbt   and i really want to educate myself so not to only see things from my white person point of view . are there any books or movies i can look at to get a better understanding of issues   poc   still face and more info on white privilege ? i do not want to be "" color blind "" anymore since that basically is living with head in the sand , but i can not seem to find a starting point to understand it . i make the mistake of thinking everyone treats everyone as equals and sadly , they do not . some people suck . i do not want to enable those people due to my ignorance . would appreciate any suggestions please - even trying to find books on my own about the topic i have seen pro white propaganda / anti   poc   material -_- * * * i am not from america , so things like ferguson & baltimore - i had no idea about the build up to that and still do not . i do not see violent racism , our police do not target black men , no k   sort of things are happening , but exclusion seems to be common . i do not understand the history , so do not know what i can do to make changes or at least shut down exclusion . any advice appreciated . thanks tl ; dr : i was "" color blind "" & realized recently that is just ignorance . want to know some history & current issues poc deal with that i can use my white privilege to help and get equality however i can .
Ex4: i have a critical question regarding representation in art and intersectional feminism , racial , and sexual identity ! first i want to say that i am a white male and i am also a comic book artist . i want to make a graphic novel that features a young latinx woman living in the city . the premise of the story is mostly undeveloped . the reason why is because i am a white male , i am unsure if it would be appropriate for me to represent the life of a latinx woman , yet i do not want to just make another narrative that features a white person as the main character . i plan of making the other characters diverse as well . but in that sense too , i am concerned that i may misrepresent the lives of women and people of color . i have done a lot of research on topics like orientalism and male privilege , which would suggest that i should not try to represent the lives of others because i have never experienced racism / sexism . on the other hand , there are just so many narratives that feature whiteness / white people , and i seek to upend that as the dominating narrative form . would it be appropriate for me to create this story ? if so what considerations should i take ? if not , then i will not go through with the idea . either way we can have a discussion on race and feminism in art !
Ex5: why i hate everyday feminism i thought i would do a post about why i hate everyday feminism . i do not mean feminism in general , i mean the website everydayfeminism . com . before you think i am a white man , i am not . i am white , jewish , female , who had learning disabilities and was in special ed and is mentally ill * *  number  . the concept of allyship . * * at first the concept of being an ally may seem like a great idea . but it is not . an ally is a term given by the "" oppressed "" group to someone privileged when they trust them . jamie utt wrote an article [  number  ways men can combat sexist entitlement in public ] (   i disagree with this article completely , but some women will label him an ally . he ' s not an ally to woman , he ' s only an ally to women who agree with his article . women are not a monolith . they make up half the worlds population , so how can you be an ally to every single one ? i can see the concept of allyship working in certain times , such as danish people or people who rescued jews were allies to jews during the holocaust . but it does not work today . everyday feminism recently wrote an article about resisting antisemitism . as a white jew i have never been discriminated against for being jewish . my dad who is from the soviet union and was discriminated there said jews are not discriminated here . i have never been stopped by the police , denied service due to being jewish or been redlined . yet someone commented "" we desperately need non - jewish allies "" . allies to whom ? if one jew or a group of jews labels someone an ally , are they also an ally merely because i am an ashkenazi . no . * *  number  . the term stupid is not ableist . * * while i have never been discriminated for being jewish or a woman , i have been discriminated by being placed in a special ed class . when carly fleischmann was  number  , she told her parents her therapists make her feel stupid by asking her to spell "" chips "" for a chip or asking her to spell her name . yes disability discrimination does exist , but the words * stupid , insane , dumb * are not ableist . the problem is everyday feminism decided those words were ableist based on a few sjws . they did not even survey the majority of disabled people other than sjws . instead they should address real discrimination against disabled people , such as saying "" everyone is a little   ocd   "" , the fact that children are segregated in special ed classrooms , or are made to learn the "" life skills "" curriculum when they can and are able to do the academic curriculum . * *  number  . some articles are stupid . * * ok , everyday feminism has a lot of great articles , such as how to support people with depression , endo and other conditions , racism and other oppressions , etc . there is an article called [ can asian - americans appropriate their own culture ? ] (   they are basically saying asian people can appropriate their own culture if they wear a bindi without realizing it ' s significance . what ? next they will say irish americans are appropriating st . patrick ' s day because they live in america , never been to ireland and think it ' s all about leprechauns . or black people from or whose parents are from africa can not say the n - word because their families were not slaves and perhaps their ancestors sold other black people to slaves . then they had an article called [ sociopaths , borderlines , and psychotics :  number  mental illnesses we must stop hating on ] (   just by reading the title you can guess what the article is about . * * they silence everyone who does not agree with their views . * * even if the person who disagrees with them is not "" privileged "" .

Ex1: was sexually harassed by children , today hey , so , i am not usually so confused about my feelings but today a group of four maybe  number  year old kids shouted that they wanted to eat my ass , etc etc inappropriate comments . i live in the city and i expect sexual harassment to be a part of my daily life but this was different . i am not enraged or anything , i am just so sad . like , who taught them that ? anyway , i will usually stand up for myself but i was so baffled and speechless by the situation that i just kept walking and i am not sure what i should have done . what are your thoughts on this ?
Ex2: i went off .   someone that i know personally was groped by a man in a college university . i ' d like to bring up something : to all the men that can assume they can do whatever they want or say whatever they want to a woman without their consent , fuck you . seriously , fuck you . you know who they are , and it might be the one reading this . do   not   underestimate the power of women . be a human being and do not harass any woman . and it ' s ironic , we have a new president sitting in the office soon . and donald trump has provided evidence that represents his radical sexism . if he becomes president , sexual harassment in america is going to be more common , and unfortunately , it already is to date . make sure you understand who you are really voting for . i have never been active on facebook ever but this needs to be addressed , and especially by a man of my age . i am  number  , and i despise the men that attempt to interrogate a woman ' s self - esteem . fuck brock turner and fuck all sexual predators . you guys are nasty low - life deplorables . now excuse me while i donate to feminist frequency and vote for the first female president of the united states .
Ex3: sexual harassment at previous workplace i left the job in  date  for various reasons . from time to time my mind wanders back to the appalling things that were mentioned while i worked there and i really want to speak up about it . keep in mind this is a veterinary practice owned and run by only one doctor , the accused . advice on steps to take ? i want him to pay for the disgusting things he ' s said to every female employee during my short time there ( only females are employed ) .

Ex1: a conversation i had with my friends brother to start off , my friend moved out for school and he took her room but took off all her decorations . she had paper butterflies that she made and put them up on the wall , which he took down . we asked him why and said he did not want a girly   room . me : .   how are butterflies girly ? .   him : they just are , i mean it ' s literally in the name . me : butter - fly .   him : i mean just look at their wings , they are all girly and pretty and .   and then he begins to just stutter realizing how dumb he sounded . how insecure can one be to the point where they are emasculated by a bug . the male ego is so fragile .
Ex2: how do i deal with a sexist friend ? i am a male , and have been an advocate for women ' s rights , but one of my friends is extremely sexist ( and slightly racist ) . he has been a friend of mine for a while and i agree with him on many other issues ( if that is the correct terminology ) . what can i do to talk with him about women ' s rights without "" just walk away from it "" ?
Ex3: just found out that my friend has assaulted women hello , i have not been here before but i need to order my thinking . yesterday i found out via a whisper network that a man i am friends with has assaulted various women . i did not hear the accounts straight from our shared acquaintances , but from a concerned source who knows i have a personal and to some extent professional relationship with the man in question . the whole thing has thrown me and i am stuck because i am not sure how to deal with this at all . i have a fair idea of which women it may concern and of course i believe them , i am just struggling as i consider him a good friend . part of me wants to challenge him , but feel this might be unfair to the unnamed parties who are understandably trying to find a way to deal with it - the whisper network exists for a reason . i also do not want to talk to him * at all * , as i am shocked and horrified - especially as his whole personal brand is all about how ' woke ' he is . i am just so confused and upset and do not know how to react or feel .

Ex1: violence against women in video games   so i read this article this morning and i am interested to hear what feminists opinion on this is . one statement that struck out to me was : "" should game developers consider implementing a gaming block that prevents players from attacking the female game characters ? "" as far as i am aware of feminism is the equality of men and women so would not denying the option to attack women in video games be sexism in itself as only men can be harmed but not women ?
Ex2: what are some great videogames that do not hypersexualize women ? my eleven year old son loves videogames . he mainly plays minecraft and lego marvel . he really likes the superhero games , but the ones i have seen are really terrible about oversexualizing women . i have had talks with him about this , and pointed out how the women are usually half naked and the men are not . the men are always leaders , smarter , more powerful . what are some great games that show women in positive roles ?
Ex3: women positively portrayed in games hello ! i ' d like to start of by saying that i have posted a similar thread in / r / gaming . but i feel like i should also ask here what you have to say in / r / feminism ! i am currently writing a paper about female characters in games ; more specifically when and how it ' s done right . i have plenty of examples of bad and degrading representations ( sadly , sigh ) . but sadly i only have a handful of examples where both women and men are portrayed equally . now i am looking for more examples of games which do it right , games that you feel made an impact or difference for you personally or on the gaming community as a whole . i hope you are able to help me with any input , also feel free to add any recommendations or notes you might have on this matter ! thank you !

Ex1: gender stereotypes in family guy   family guy is an american adult animated sitcom created by seth macfarlane . the series has been airing at primetime for over a decade (  number  - present ) . the hit show centers on the griffins , a lower middle class family that lives in the fictional city of quahog . the show has made millions laugh but some of the material in the show is no laughing matter , especially the portrayal of gender in the main characters . the use of gender stereotypes in family guy can be inappropriate . we only got our evidence from one episode of family guy out of the  number  episodes , but there were plenty of example in the short  number  minutes . we watched season  number  episode  number  . let ’ s start of with peter griffin . peter shown as a fat , lazy , drunk idiot . the list goes on . peter is uneducated and because of this and his stupidity his job is on the assembly line in a toy factory ( where all employees appear to be men . ) . he likes sitting on his couch drinking beer and watching tv . he also speaks about how it is his duty to provide for his family “ as the man of the house ” . he has some nice quotes from this episode like “ it ’ s ok to lie to women , they are not people like us . ” next lois , lois is shown as nagging , housewife , always ends up condoning peter ’ s actions . in the show , she seems completely dependent on peter ’ s income as she is a full time mom for stewie . most of meg ’ s dialogue was her complaining about something . whether it was about her family or her own looks . she gets a cosmetic surgery when peter gets money because she only cared about her surgery and kept complaining about her lips throughout the whole episode . the other two main characters , stewie and brian , are a little bit harder probably due to the fact that they are a baby and an anthropomorphic dog . neither of them displayed any serious gender stereotypes in this episode ( they didn ’ t say or do much ) . these stereotypes can be pretty harmful when people interpret them too seriously and apply them to their lives . also they can be outright offensive to women and men as well . but that brings us to our second point . this show is a comedy . it is made to make people laugh and they do that by using extremes of stereotypes and animated figures . these stereotypes are so blatant that it is funny sometimes . it is a cartoon that points out the wrong in our society , and we need to keep in mind this as we watch most adult cartoons .

Ex2: menstrual leave : yay or nay it ' s something we are considering as a startup . no one will have to pick up anyone else ' s work , female employees will simply have to manage their time . note that we give new parents of both genders extended leaves and flexible hours afterwards . how do you feel about it ? does it give the perception that women are flimsy flowers and take away from years of seeking equality in the work place . here is my rationale : i have seen women in incredibly competitive environments have to power through bad period pains because it ' s bad form to go home just because it ' s "" time of the month "" . they would get bashed not from men .   but women bosses . and no one should have to work when in that sort of discomfort . whenever the topic comes up , i have men and women arguing that men should get the same time off . but i fail to see how the rationale behind it . i personally feel that women have twice the load . not only do they work bloody hard to be taken seriously at work but they have also been handed really shit cards by nature . and i feel it ' s basic corporate social responsibility to remove that disadvantage or at least compensate for it so that the race is truly equal . there are women who choose to [ take some measures ] (   like stopping their periods to get ahead at work . and that ' s fine .   i fully support their decision and good on them for taking control . but why are they forced to make a choice ? please let me know if this belongs in a different sub . edit : adding a link to this "" despite the majority of women taking painkillers and trying to carry on as normal , dysmenorrhea – the clinical term for painful menstruation – interferes with the daily lives of women . around  percent  of menstruating women experience pain and discomfort during their period , according to the   nhs   . a professor of reproductive health at university college london recently said cramping can be "" as bad as having a heart attack "" .

Ex3: how can companies improve their income disparity using data driven methodologies ? hi , i was wondering about this because , in my experience , there are more statistics talking about the inequality of men and women in the workplace than improvement related to income . for example , if a company wants to "" help "" feminism and equality , they will just fill the workplace with  number  -  number  , and used as a pr to say they are helping , but , if the main goal is to reach equality in the selection process and equity of income , how can we create or implement tools to measure that those goals are being achieved without bias . i was thinking about the software some companies use to capture hours of work and measure if men and women that are working the same hours and the same positions are getting paid fair . or if from those  number  -  number  in the workplace how is deconstructed for positions , areas and income . because , i see some feminists pushing just this idea that fueling the  number  -  number  is a the best thing when i think you will may achieve equality but not equity and thats kinda sexist because women are now told that just because are women they must be hired and not because they have the capability and the intelligence to do the job . i am just trying to wire this thing and be the most objective possible , so how can we push more data driven analysis so we can cut the bias as much as possible ?
Ex4: i get groped or someone tries to force themselves on me everyday at work . please , tell me if i ’ m blowing this out of proportion of quit edit : * or ( sorry for the typo in the post title ) i work as a hostess at a lounge . i ’ ve only worked like six shifts and i ’ ve been groped or someone has tried to force themselves to kiss me everyday . the people groping me are clients of the lounge . left to my own devices , i would probably punch them or yell at them but i also feel compelled to be as cordial as possible because i don ’ t want to lose my job or cause a scene at work . so , there ’ s a weird power dynamic . so far , two managers have witnessed it happen . they seem sympathetic . but , one has said “ you need to smack their hands ” and the other has said “ you can ’ t just let people feel on you ” . these feel like hurtful responses to me , almost as if i ’ m being reprimanded somehow . last night , a guy asked me out on a date , i refused , and he tried to force me to kiss him . so , they sent me home an hour early because i guess i was visibly upset . i just don ’ t understand how that was an appropriate solution . am i blowing this out of proportion or is this just wrong and what do i do about this ? it ’ s just exhausting . i want to quit but i need to money .

6,Family,"Ex1: danger me and my daughter moved to an unexpectedly horrifying small city . we are enduring one blow after another , and being stalked by more than three creepy men . i am very scared for my beautiful daughter , and am trying to create a quick online presence to document my worries . we live in pueblo colorado .
Ex2: how can a daughter explain a mother , who firmly believes into men / women inequalities , that her jokes and remarks that stick an image to each sex are not funny ? the daughter is  number  years old . she gets remarks on how to dress and behave properly . she has to lie , pretending she has no friends of the other sex . every complaint on a joke or a remark immediately starts a dispute . god plays a role in the justification of the inequalities . a women has a "" duty "" as a woman toward god . she has to be sweet and charming , attentive , to not laugh too much with men , etc . and attacking the god argument means blasphemy . the situation goes beyond jokes and remarks , but having them stopped would reduce the pressure . the situation goes beyond men / women inequalities , but i try to keep it relevant to this subreddit ( i will move this thread if it should be posted elsewhere ) . i can try to give more details if needed . - - - - - - - i am not the daughter in question . i am the usual suspect , the white cis male . i deeply believe that doing this on her behalf is fundamentaly wrong ; it would be better to have her ask for help ( here or anywhere ) , and explain the situation with her own words and knowledge of the situation . at first , i told her that she could to this to get some help , but for various reasons she refused . i do have her agreement to post this , and i will give her a link to this thread .
Ex3: what are your thoughts on equal rights in terms of raising a child from birth while separated ? it seems as though society is based on the notion that mothers are natural born nurturers and that the attatchment to the mother is priority over a bond with the father . in most cases a child born with separated parents , the father is to pay full amounts of child support and only allowed "" access "" in some cases until the child is  number  years old without discussion of custody or overnight stays . how , in any way does this affect the view point of the certain roles of women and men in society as equals in regards to raising a child and the importance of each gender , with men essentially at first being seen as a provider of financial support solely with limited access to a child ' s life legally and of course including the phsycological effects for the development of the wellbeing of the child . is there any contradictions to equality as far as how society is set up currently in this view point ? assuming the father is on board and prepared to care for that child in any way possible .
Ex4: my father the feminist : i ’ m a teenage girl , who is will graduate high school this year . since i ’ m beginning the big transition of “ leaving the nest ” , i ’ ve spent a lot of my time reflecting on the person that i ’ ve become . and how my father is very much a big hero of mine . my father considers himself a “ feminist ” of sorts . and he has instilled quite a bit of confidence in me over the years . for a long time i was ashamed to be female . people would jokingly tell my i was going to be “ the first woman president ” when i expressed my passion for politics . but i didn ’ t want that . i wanted to be judged by my qualifications , not my gender . my father has given me fascinating perspective . he often corrects me when i apologize for speaking up or being shy if i ’ m the only girl in a group . “ you shouldn ’ t have to apologize for having an opinion or being who you are . ” he says , “ that ’ s a rampant problem that women have to face . i want you to be more than that , because i believe you can be . ” he never has installed gender roles into me . on the one hand , i love makeup and gossiping about boys , and on the other i love playing video games and football . my father makes me forget that i ’ m a woman in a male - dominated world . he makes me proud to be myself , my gender aside . my father is how i feel about feminism . we shouldn ’ t even think about a person ’ s gender when we judge their character . we shouldn ’ t patronize women or focus on them simply because they ’ re women . we should just accept them for who they are , and cultivate their passions . haha rant over . the point is , i love my father  happy 
Ex5: what do you all think about father / daughter dates ? i ’ ve seen some posts on reddit and even from some facebook friends about fathers who take their daughters on “ dates ” where they have one - on - one time , get all dressed up , and go dancing somewhere ( or movies , or something else pretty close to what an actual date is ) . typically the daughters are between  number  and  number  years of age . i think the idea is to have their daughters understand what respectful men are like and to have time to bond with their fathers . well , something about it really rubs me the wrong way , but i can ’ t quite articulate why . can you please share your thoughts about this practice , the intentions behind it , whether you do this ( or would do this ) with your own family , etc ? i ’ d like to hear so i can better understand my own thoughts on it .   tia

7,Sex / Porn,"Ex1: is there any porn platform for consensual sex ? i thought i had found it with makelovenotporn . tv cause they sold it as consensual sex but i later found the "" _50 % of the proceeds from your rental ( revenue , less hosting / bandwidth / transaction costs ) go to the  hashtag  make love not pornstar   who submitted their video "" _ clause in their how it works article . but how would anyone know that it is actual consenting sex if financial incentive can substitute for consent ? i am being kind here , cause there is actually nothing to discern this platform from any other porn site aside from being exclusively "" amateur "" . yet they seem to use the  hashtag  real world sex   hashtag so i figure maybe there are other ones out there that are actually consensual . if you could share them with us it would be awesome . it ' s been a year since i figured the girls i masturbated to were being "" raped "" so i nearly stopped watching live porn and i miss it . thanks  laugh 
Ex2: why are sexbots a problem according to feminists ? i have a bit trouble understanding the problem some feminists seems to have with sexbots , some seems to suggest they are supposed to "" take over "" the position of women among men . i do not understand how anyone who label themselves as a feminist could suggest that . since they are just meant for sex , kinda like a dildo or some other sex toy , are the feminists who are opposed them suggesting that sex is all women are for ?
Ex3: new york post article that women are providing too much ' easy sex ' and not holding men accountable . how do we feel about this ?   just stumbled upon this article . the basic point is that women are ' giving up ' sex pre marriage , and that because of that men do not feel the need to ' improve ' themselves in order to ' obtain ' sex and in that instance a wife . comparisons that sex is a drug and that men now somehow do not need to become functional members of society as they can get sex otherwise ( ? )

8,Gendered Roles,"Ex1: i am not a receptionist ! ( are they are any other labor working women here ? ) so , i am a female and i work in a tire shop . whenever someone asks me where i work i tell them that i work at a tire shop . the conversation usually ends there and they do not ask any more questions . then , months go by of knowing each other and i will tell them about some awful story about how somone ' s lug nuts were too swollen and blah , blah , blah and then this always happens .   they interrupt and they say , "" wait , you work with the tools . "" i just think yeah , that ' s why i said i work in a shop . and then they continue to tell me they always assumed i was the receptionist . i will admit , this is both funny and annoying to me . now , to be fair , i am the only woman at my job . i also do not know any one else like me . and tgat got me thinking . so , are there any other women on here who work labor intensive jobs ? do you have stories too ? i want to know !
Ex2: menstrual leave : yay or nay it ' s something we are considering as a startup . no one will have to pick up anyone else ' s work , female employees will simply have to manage their time . note that we give new parents of both genders extended leaves and flexible hours afterwards . how do you feel about it ? does it give the perception that women are flimsy flowers and take away from years of seeking equality in the work place . here is my rationale : i have seen women in incredibly competitive environments have to power through bad period pains because it ' s bad form to go home just because it ' s "" time of the month "" . they would get bashed not from men .   but women bosses . and no one should have to work when in that sort of discomfort . whenever the topic comes up , i have men and women arguing that men should get the same time off . but i fail to see how the rationale behind it . i personally feel that women have twice the load . not only do they work bloody hard to be taken seriously at work but they have also been handed really shit cards by nature . and i feel it ' s basic corporate social responsibility to remove that disadvantage or at least compensate for it so that the race is truly equal . there are women who choose to [ take some measures ] (   like stopping their periods to get ahead at work . and that ' s fine .   i fully support their decision and good on them for taking control . but why are they forced to make a choice ? please let me know if this belongs in a different sub . edit : adding a link to this "" despite the majority of women taking painkillers and trying to carry on as normal , dysmenorrhea – the clinical term for painful menstruation – interferes with the daily lives of women . around  percent  of menstruating women experience pain and discomfort during their period , according to the   nhs   . a professor of reproductive health at university college london recently said cramping can be "" as bad as having a heart attack "" .

Ex4: i get groped or someone tries to force themselves on me everyday at work . please , tell me if i ’ m blowing this out of proportion of quit edit : * or ( sorry for the typo in the post title ) i work as a hostess at a lounge . i ’ ve only worked like six shifts and i ’ ve been groped or someone has tried to force themselves to kiss me everyday . the people groping me are clients of the lounge . left to my own devices , i would probably punch them or yell at them but i also feel compelled to be as cordial as possible because i don ’ t want to lose my job or cause a scene at work . so , there ’ s a weird power dynamic . so far , two managers have witnessed it happen . they seem sympathetic . but , one has said “ you need to smack their hands ” and the other has said “ you can ’ t just let people feel on you ” . these feel like hurtful responses to me , almost as if i ’ m being reprimanded somehow . last night , a guy asked me out on a date , i refused , and he tried to force me to kiss him . so , they sent me home an hour early because i guess i was visibly upset . i just don ’ t understand how that was an appropriate solution . am i blowing this out of proportion or is this just wrong and what do i do about this ? it ’ s just exhausting . i want to quit but i need to money .

Ex1: nature vs nurture in 3 rd wave feminism serious discussion ? how does biology impact the neurological effect on our thought processes and concepts of gender and equality ? what is the modern feminists stand on the physiological differences in the genders physical neural wiring ; i . e . ; what concessions between genders is acceptable if we are hard wired ?
Ex2: judith butler : why do some critics of feminism dislike her ? i had read this article today that i personally felt like "" judith butler is wrong and so is gender theory ! "" , and at some points it felt like the author was trying to disprove feminism . it basically boiled down to sex and gender are linked and that ' s the truth .   there are things that i am confused about the article , and i wanted to know your opinion on the article .
Ex3: might the pink tax just be a product of higher demand ? i was inspired to make this post by / u / jessyagressy ' s post citing [ this article ] (   i thought that maybe it would show only women ' s products that are more expensive , but it also showed some where men ' s products are more expensive . as a guy myself , i think that it might actually be accurate ( at least when it identified when a men ' s product was more expensive , which i know i have seen before ) . &  hashtag  x 200 b   ; though i can not be sure it ' s a good source , it sparked something in my mind . is it possible that the pink tax is just a result of higher demand on the women and men ' s end of consuming the product ? it would make sense , then , to separate men and women ' s products in some cases because you could charge women or men more for products their society asks them to use more often based on their gender , whether cultural or biological . in the end , then , i wonder how the pink tax became , well , the "" pink tax "" , in popular culture . i mean , it seems more accurate to say that the pink tax is a result of corporations taking advantage of cultural gender roles and expectations rather than simply taxing women more , whether or not it ' s justified . but "" gender tax "" is probably not a great buzzword . simply put , the thesis of this thought is that to eliminate the pink tax would need the elimination of gendered buying of products . i suppose this is similar in theory to how gender - neutral toys should be pushed for by changing the culture surrounding "" well this is for boys "" or "" this is for girls "" , though some things like women ' s health products would be the exclusion . &  hashtag  x 200 b   ; anyways , just wanted to point out a few things from the nbc article itself . shaving gel being more expensive for men makes sense under this theory because i have never heard of a girl using shaving gel on her body . razor blades costing more for women than men makes sense just based on how much more of the body a blade is used on , implying that women might need more blades than men and drive up demand a bit higher . shaving cream may be more expensive for women not because of demand , but the product itself being made to be used on skin that is not on your face and neck ( generally softer , at least for men ) designer perfume being more expensive for women makes sense .   maybe . i do not know enough , i have not used cologne in my life . the only thing that threw me off was the deodorant   and   the body spray costing more for women . you ' d think that one of them would be more expensive for men based on demand .

Ex1: i am curious about something involving women in motorsports hi , just going to clarify quickly , i am a gay male who believes in equality for people of all genders , races , religions , etc . i am a big fan of motorsports , and i always have been . i have noticed over the years though that theres a distinct lack of female drivers in motorsports . i am curious as for why this might be , so i am asking you why you think women drivers are infrequently seen in motorsports . it ' d be nice to see a more even grid in fairness , and i am curious as to what women think about it too . i am tired of women being used as nothing more than a sex object to be pictured next to the cars , why dont you do the driving more ?
Ex2: honest question comparing our more equitable present to a time when men were predominantly the sole earners in a household , did the influx of women into the labor force saturate the job market ? i am trying to analyze this strictly from an economics point of view , not from a social or opinionated standpoint . i see two scenarios : a : males earn x ( total economic payout ) money , factories produce y amount of product , female average free time = z . product production satisfies consumer population , livable conditions . b : males earn x /  number  money , females earn x /  number  money , factory now produces y + amount of product from added female population , average female free time = z - working hours . product production grows , prices drop across the board as demand decreases , single males and females have reduced buying power due to salary reduction . now the question : is there some accurate way to measure the amount of free time that women have given up in relation to the percentage price drop in consumer goods and reduction of male salaries ? how does this affect single earners in our economy , and their ability to survive ? does it force more people to enter the workforce than in the past ? just trying to understand the effects , not cause an argument . thanks .
Ex3: representation of women in live performance - female figures in french theatre i recently did a walking tour around paris focused on the historical under - representation of female figures in french theatre , and would like to hear others thoughts about the performing arts industry in other cities . i find the role of women within theatre is an interesting example , historically when only men were actors and played both male and female roles , then the inclusion of female actresses often ostracized from society for their roles , and under - representation of female playwrights ( collette ! )   nyt   article about under - representation of women in paris theatre scene : [   some french women changing the theatre scene on and off stage : [   women of paris walking tours bringing light to forgotten female figures in french history : [

Ex1: so .   is reddit generally anti - feminist ? in an r / askreddit thread , i made the mistake of implying that patriarchy exists , *( shock horror ! )* and that its values can have negative effects for men as well as women . ( e . g . motherhood is a woman ' s ' natural role ' therefore men are at a disadvantage i am custody battles ) . people seemed to get quite pissed off about it and assume that i hate all men .   which was certainly not what i wanted to convey . i explained my point roughly as i did above . it ' s not something that i am upset about . explained myself calmly and rationally and even made light of the situation . so is my experience unique ? do you guys find larger subs like askreddit jump on feminist - leaning comments with a lot of vitriol without seeming to actually address your point ? maybe i live in a liberal bubble but i was quite surprised to the reaction to what i considered an innocuous comment . sorry if this post is inappropriately placed here . i have read the rules and i think it should be ok .
Ex2: why is most of reddit afraid of feminism ? every time i mention it or stand up to someone making fun of feminism or being a blatant misogynist , i get immediately attacked by multiple people in the thread . like they are all afraid of it or want to deny it exists . it seems to me all the people that have something to say about feminism are men . why ' s that ? there ' s never any women as far as i can tell by usernames that tell me i am wrong doing , etc . this has been bugging me for awhile . any ideas ? edit : thanks for all your opinions . considering them all i have a better understanding , or on some , * do not * , of why this topic is disclosed so greatly and so often . sorry i can not reply to everyone .
Ex3: how do you feel about lesbians putting down men ? i used to belong to this sub , which recently allowed a thread called "" men are annoying "" . although i am a feminist , i try to stay objectively equal , and i do not agree that we should be putting down the entire male gender . here ' s the link to the thread :   some excerpts : "" i am hating men more and more everyday , they are annoying as fuck . "" "" after listening to men all day at work , i am ready for the first ticket out of here . "" "" the only men i love are my nephews . all the other men are just stupid and gross . "" keep in mind , this sub is supposedly extremely harsh with anyone who even hovers around intolerance . they will ban anyone who comes close to transphobia or sexism towards women . i just think it makes me feel awful as a lesbian that the most popular lesbian sub on reddit is allowing this kind of discussion . what if we substituted "" men "" with "" women "" ? i ' d be furious ! seems pretty intolerant to me . just wondering if you guys support this kind of talk and i am alone in thinking this is wrong . thanks .

Ex1: women - centric events in tech sexist ? i have been asked to attend a women in tech event next week , to which my male manager got annoyed , stating that women in tech events are sexist . i sort of spluttered , "" but every other event   is a male in tech event   . "" and can not say i made my point very well or concisely . i was hoping this community , which is likely much more versed in promoting awareness of feminist issues etc , could help me tighten up my point ? he will bring this up again , and it ' s important to have this conversation with him for the sake of myself and the other women that work with him . are women in tech events sexist ? i ' d be very grateful for your thoughts .
Ex2: fed up with my customers . how do you respond to microaggressions ? i am a barista . every day , i hear men laugh at themselves or others for ordering what they consider "" girly "" drinks . i have one customer who orders theirs with almond milk , and every day without fail , his friends tease him for it . last week , a man ordered a latte . he said , "" and throw some of that sissy stuff in it . "" i said , "" sissy stuff ? "" "" yeah , that girly bullshit . "" "" i do not know what you mean by that . "" "" that shit over there "" \ * points to syrup pumps \ * "" oh . i think that ' s just called sweetener . "" one of the most infuriating moments was months ago , when a woman ordered a black coffee and left . the next customer , a man , laughed and said , "" do you think that drink was for her , or her boss ? "" implying that  number  ) no woman drinks black coffee ,  number  ) this woman was someone ' s assistant , and  number  ) her boss was man , who of course drinks black coffee . i am honestly tired of it . every day , it ' s either the drinks , men calling me love / sweetie / honey , male coworkers taking over a job to "" help "" me when i am perfectly capable myself , or something else . what do you do when you come across little things like this ? obviously a single action or comment is small in isolation , and no decent human does or says these things to intentionally hurt me or others . still , i firmly believe that these small actions and comments are what make up our institutionalized sexism . how often do you let these things slide ? how often do you call them out ? do you have rules for yourself when calling them out ( e . g . never at work , only when it feels safe to do so , or only if this person is a repeat offender ) ? how direct are you when you call out this behavior ( i . e . do you challenge superficially * "" i can lift this myself , actually "" * or more deeply * "" i think you only offered to carry this for me because i am a woman . ""  wink  ? * * tl ; dr : * * my customers and coworkers say / do small and passively sexist things , like most of the world . i oscillate between wanting to stand up for myself and wanting to let it slide . how do you handle subtly sexist actions / comments ?
Ex3: is using sweetheart sexist or offensive ? i know this is a really odd question , but people have told me that calling a woman sweetheart is sexist , and people have also told me it ' s okay . so i ' d like your guy ' s opinion since , well you seem like experts . so , is calling women sweetheart sexist ?

Ex1: how can i convince "" meninist "" women ( typically very young ) that reverse sexism is no real ? they are usually perpetuating the same thing that they accuse radical feminists of : refusing to consider the deep - rooted issues of the other side . the issue is that there are not any deep - rooted issues associated with male disadvantage like the commonly referenced losing custody cases , having to "" man up "" , etc . the deep - rooted part is not that they are being oppressed into being masculine ; it ' s that they are being "" oppressed "" into being not - feminine ( which is indicative of female oppression , not male , for obvious reasons ) . it ' s hard to convince them of the argument that completing the "" feminist agenda "" would simultaneously free men of their "" oppression "" , since it itself is rooted in anti - female history ; they are too caught up in over - proving to everyone that they are fighting for equality and sex - blindness , contrary to this "" crazy "" radical feminism , even when it is a male that is posing the argument . the greater issue is the blatant misunderstanding of the meanings of "" sexism "" and "" oppression "" when used in context ( should be the only meanings , as the casual uses dilute their potency , causing problems like this to arise ) . but each time , "" the dictionary says .   "" position is argued as infallible . it is dangerous to have this split in understanding within the sex itself , since it just adds more disbelief regarding the legitimacy of feminist theory . how do we mend this ?
Ex2: sexist subconscious whenever i read about a professor , or perhaps a doctor , or a lawyer , in my mind i always picture a man when gender is not specified . i hate this about myself . i only noticed this trait because of my surprise in these situations when later in the text the subject is revealed to be a woman . i am then immediately ashamed that i would be surprised , even for a second . does anyone have any advice or experience of dealing with this type of subconscious sexism ?
Ex3: sexism project to promote awareness for equality of women hi reddit / feminism i am currently working on a school research project in which the goal is to make people aware of the issue of sexism . i have finished the project but am finding it to be a little dull . i was hoping to get some first hand sources that i could possibly quote in the research project . any discussions / answers are appreciated ! here are my questions  number  . what is your general definition of sexism ?  number  . is there just one type of sexism ? can you explain ?  number  . can women be sexist ? how ?  number  . what would you consider casual sexism and how does this affect people ? can you explain ? those are some of my questions , hoping to do some good with this presentation and change some of the minds of some sexist students .
Ex4: question about a specific instance of sexism in a discussion so my girlfriend and i were talking about something and we got on the topic of something that happened to her friend . she was at the beach and a guy driving past smiled and waved at her , i am not sure what to think . my immediate reaction is to say no this is not sexist , she thinks it is . i also know that we both come from very different backgrounds . she is from korea where sexism is a very real thing , and i grew up in california where people do that sort of thing all the time ( guys to girls and girls to guys , or dudes to dudes which ever way you swing ) . i also know that i cant see it in the same light because i am a guy and we do not ever get complimented , so this sort of thing would just be flattering . i want to know what you guys think if you do not mind me asking .

Ex1: is there such a thing as “ toxic femininity ” ? “ the concept of toxic masculinity is used in the social sciences to describe traditional norms of behavior among men in contemporary american and european society that are associated with detrimental social and psychological effects . such "" toxic "" masculine norms include dominance , devaluation of women , extreme self - reliance , and the suppression of emotions . ” are there behaviors that are traditionally feminine that could be defined as toxic ? can we define them and work to change them ?
Ex2: can someone explain toxic masculinity , and why it is being discussed . toxic masculinity is a concept i have hears from people shouting on the streets and in youtube videos about why men as a whole are a group of evil creatures . i have heard toxic masculinity described as the social norm of men expected to stand strong and not show excess emotions , and i have also heard about toxic masculinity oppressing women and being a choice of men . i think it ' s better to hear it straight from the horse ' s mouth .
Ex3: "" modern family "" what ' s your take on the show ? my so and i are watching modern family . before the  hashtag  me too   movement i was oblivious about .   basically everything . i never thought of this racism as a structure , feminism and stuff like that before , because well . it just did not cross my mind and without knowing i just accepted things the way they were . now i am rewatching the shows . i am so annoyed . it ' s homophobic , sexist , toxic masculinity and racist . i , especially get frustrated by the jay pritchet role . in my opinion he ' s old entitled white man who critises and bullies everyone because they do not meet up to his standard and his view on the world . and , he always regrets his actions in the end of the show . again , and again . and every comment he makes is demeaning and critising . i blurted out to my boyfriend that he was an old entitled prick and he of all , annoyed me the most . he thinks i am overthinking and that he is funny , nice and caring and much better than the overprotective mother of manny . it hit me , that he ' s still not enlightened and does not want to . and , i think that the majority of people still is not . i have tried to research on the show , but havent found much . what ' s your take on this very , loved and popular show ?   edit   : the homophobic / toxic masculinity : i am tired of everyone constantly commenting the gays in the show , they are missing manliness - all the small comments on how they do not fit in binary way of living . just because there are homosexuals in tge show , it doesnt mean that there can be a underlying of phobia and toxic masculinity . the micro comments are meant to be funny but in this constant amount i find it homophic and simply not funny . there are more "" homo - jokes "" and "" not manly enough jokes "" than anything else . both the gay couple and manny are constantly getting ribbed for not being masculine enough .

Ex2: i was raped in an abusive relationship and the only source of support i have is the online community i was slapped , choked , degraded , insulted , dehumanised , forced to have sex , used for my money , my social connections , my body , my time and energy by a fucking bastard . i was a teenager , he was a full grown adult . i was clueless , he was a serial manipulator . i was kind , he made use of my kindness . i was suicidal because of him , he was completely unconcerned and guiltless . i was ' crazy ' , a ' vixen ' , a ' slut ' , ' not worth a penny ' , a ' whore ' , even though i had zero sex drive . okay actually he did buy me a drink before , a  money  bottle of water , very kind of him for all he has done to me . i think he even talked to me kindly before ! not to hook me and manipulate me of course ! why would he ? he is innocent ! the police did not help me , did not give me a reason why they closed the case , did not respond to my calls and email , just left me in the unknown . he is innocent ! his school ignored all my emails and claimed i was ' harassing ' their student , told me to go to the law enforcement even though i already said they ain ' t doing shit . he is innocent ! his church thinks i am a terrorist for saying what i said ( that he raped and abused me ) and ignores me . thinks i am being an irrational harassing bitch who is trying to ruin a guy ' s life . he is innocent ! my parents told me its no big deal and that it happens to everyone , told me that i should have been more prudent ( i am darn prudent and innocent okay , naive but prudent as hell ) , told me to stop obsessing about the past and that i should have moved on by now . he is innocent and i am trying to ruin his life ! my friends make rape jokes in my face . made me take a long leave from school and change majors to avoid them . made me change my name and physical appearance to hide from them . oh one of them even started molesting me and following me everywhere asking me for sex around even though i threaten to beat them up after they realise the guy is not caught . everyone is innocent but me ! the feminist organisation in my country is not being helpful by constantly postponing me though i was in dire need of support . is this because i am a student and can not pay fees ? okay they know he is not innocent but they are not doing anything to help either . him ? he is so goddamn innocent even if he murdered babies he is completely fucking innocent ! he is free and living his life happily like nothing ever happened , planning to get married and have kids ! going to church doing community service ! helping the world and making it a better place ! threatening to sue me for harassment if i continue what i do ! because he is a good guy ! why am i on all places but reddit   trying to get help ? - - - by the way this is not the first time i got raped i got raped many times before some more brutal than this . why ? cuz i am naive , eager , over friendly , open and do not know how to protect myself according to my therapists . i am already working on it so that ' s not a problem anymore . - - - also i typed this post while i am very emotional so i hope you guys do not mind it , i do not want to delete it since it is already posted it . i do have help from people though it is because they do not know what to do about the situation hence they are doing the wrong things such as victim blaming , but they do try to help . however the part about me revealing that i was assaulted and hence targeted by more people who i used to trust is true . i have help , though way less than i deserve and way later than i should have been helped . in fact none of these should have happened in the first place and i should have never had to find help in the first place . i have help in terms of professional help , just not the familial and the friendship type .
Ex3: breaking the silence on sexual abuse hello , i got permission from one of the moderators to post this . i started the subreddit [ r / breakthesilence ] (   to help sexual abuse and child abuse survivors share their stories and seek encouragement or advice or just help raise awareness . since i am from the amish i would like to encourage survivors from churches to share their stories or give advice to others but everyone is welcome . through this subreddit i have been able to help quite a few people who were in need . one thirteen - year - old girl said the subreddit popped up online when she searching and messaged me through it . her six - year - old sister was being sexually abused and i was able to guide her to her teacher and principal who called in   cps   . the sister was removed from her dad ' s custody as a result . i have a psychologist and a teacher who follow this subreddit and jump in and help where they can . if you would like to join just to be there to help when someone else post asking for help that would be amazing . i do all i can but we all have different areas of experience and that is very valuable . thank you to the moderators for letting me post this and thank you to everyone who shares or jumps in to help  happy

Ex1: is this legitimate criticism of intersectional feminism , or does the author misses the point ? i have been reading these articles by a "" factual feminist "" called eva glasrud on her website called the happy talent . what i got from this article is that she does not like the use of the term "" white feminism "" as criticism of any problematic behaviour that other ( mainly white ) feminist do . that she ' s not a big fan of the website everyday feminism , and does not believe that cultural appropriation is a big deal . what ' s your thoughts and opinions on her view .     also her view on cultural appropriation       edit   : added more links .
Ex2: guy with a question about cultural appropriation i wanna start this off by saying , i am not an anti - feminist or a feminist and i am not looking for a debate about it , this is just something i have been curious about regarding cultural appropriation . my question is : if your child was interested in native american culture or history and wanted to get a headdress , what would you do . the reason i am asking this is because whilst i can understand that certain groups of people may feel strongly about it , i can not help but wonder if a child should not be allowed to do something because it may offend someone else . again , i am honestly not looking to offend anyone with this , i am just curious .
Ex3: cultural appropriation what ' s the deal with cultural appropriation exactly ? i get that if there ' s something of deep serious significance to a culture then turning it into a party gag is disrespectful , but i refuse to believe anyone can not wear braids because of their race . it ' s their hair for crying out loud .

------------------------------

Ex1: what is your opinion on studies comparing men and women with outcomes like this ? recently , a [ post ] (   was made in / r / dataisbeautiful in which the grip strength of a sample size of around  number  people was tested . i am trying to have a better understanding of gender theory and feminism . i understand that stereotypes often lead to dangerous results and hold society back from fully accepting individuals for who they are . but i also think that there is some truth to dividing the olympics , for example , into men ' s and women ' s events . what do you think about this ? also , where do you think transgender athletes can fit into this ? just looking to hear your opinion , thank you .
Ex2: good women ' s and gender studies graduate programs in canada ? hi ! i am an undergraduate student studying in new brunswick , canada , and i am looking to pursue an ma in women ' s and gender studies . i am having a hard time finding any reviews / etc . of   wgst   grad programs in canada , so i thought i would ask here . my main concerns going forward in this whole mess of a grad school application process are : - i want to have a program that is largely course - based ( or has that option ) - have good ties to the community / opportunities to get involved , internships , etc . - takes an intersectional approach ( which i am sure most of them do ( or should do ) by now , but just want to stress this ! ) if anyone is in any   wgst   grad programs , or knows someone who is , please tell me what you think !
Ex3: gendered morality and backlash effects in online discussions : an experimental study on how users respond to hate speech comments against women and sexual minorities women who make hateful remarks on social media are likely to be judged more severely than men who make the same comments . this is also true for reactions to hate speech ( counter speech ) which when made by women are less accepted than counter speech from men . this is according to a study published in springer ’ s journal sex roles by claudia wilhelm and sven joeckel of the university of erfurt in germany .

------------------------------

Ex1: can a "" girls only night "" be a "" feminist takeover "" hello everyone ! i have a question , regarding views towards "" girls only nights "" . at a local club we had a so called "" feminist takeover "" - party in which only woman and trans people were allowed in . the reason for this party is to create a safe - space for women and trans people . so men were not allowed in . this club is a left wing club . and i had a argument with a friend about it , because i ( m ) think , that excluding men from a party just because of their gender is sexist . because this means , that every man is a potential attacker and could harm or harass a woman or trans , which is generalizing . i see how harassment needs to be stopped but in a different way . the club is already active in doing so , by having awareness staff around , where they stop men in case they do harass others and talk to the people about the issue . personally i can understand that ( some ) trans and women would like to have a safe space out of fear . but in my opinion just locking the "" threat "" out , but not considering that it is not a real threat is no solution for me . also this is happening in germany , where women are seen very equal compared to other countries / cultures . in the end there were only about  number  visitors compared to a few hundred normally . at least i think also that groups of people often go girls / boys mixed and do not want to go in that case . i just do not think , that this is a feminist act to do , and could be okay , but letting a person in or not , just because of their gender identification is wrong to me and should not be called feminist . i would be glad to hear your opinion about this topic , and maybe i am not understanding a few problems here , because i am male , but i even had a few female friends on this side of the argument .
Ex2: some stuff about gender and sex i hope people can read this in good faith and understand i deffs do not want to question how anyone identifies . so someone on another subreddit asked and deleted a rant about hating terfs for excluding trans people , and i had a response i ' d like to have a chat about . i also want to say that trans women are women and even if this conversation makes you uncomfortable because you want to support trans rights , i think we still gotta talk about this more , because   imo   theres a lot of confusion about sex / gender and how we relate with those , especially when transitioning . so here was my response to an "" anti -   terf   "" post . "" what i think is badly needed is a conversation about gender , how that relates to being trans , and how we can all live . many   terfs   exist and they need to be more sympathetic to trans women and accept them as "" real women "" , but there is also the fact that , as a feminist , trans people adhering to gender norms is definitely something i have questions about . i am not saying trans people are not valid and real and all that supportice stuff , but i think there ' s a huge amount of stuff within all this gender identity and sex stuff and screaming matches do not help . i dont want to unite against terfs who i can convince or understand instead . i ' d rather we all listen to each other . and yeah some people are juat assholes who do not want to accept other people , but i also think there ' s a real conversation about gender in there . ""
Ex3: anger in public spaces can somebody point me to sources that talk about the notion of anger , the politics behind its display in public spaces , especially through a trans feminist perspective ? thanks . trans - feminist here . inspired by black feminism , trans feminism . also is there a black feminism subreddit ? thanks again !

Ex1: feminist books for kids / young adults hi all , new here so forgive any innocent transgressions , will try my hardest to understand and respect the etiquette ! i bought my  number  y / o sister the "" i am malala "" book for christmas . she reads at a high level and with her going to high school ( uk ) next year i thought it would be worthwhile attempting to get her started on some entry - level feminism . i was happily surprised she both read and enjoyed the book far more than any of the other ( largely fiction , not overtly political ) books i or anyone else got her . i was wondering if someone could help me with some suggestions of similar stuff for her . specifically looking for feminist works with an intersectional bent as she ' s of the social background that means she will almost certainly across the more bourgeois white feminist stuff on her own ( although i have heard moran writes some admittedly good stuff for girls of her age ) . i was thinking of buying her something on rosa luxemburg my friend bought his sister for xmas . she did mention that she really enjoyed how the book was written as a non - fiction story told in a fiction style so something enjoyable that will keep her engaged would be perfect . thanks for your help !
Ex2: i need a book to educate a young man about consent etc !   please help . i am buying a load of books for a  number  year old guy who doesnt have the first idea about puberty etc . i have found the basic books quite easily and i plan to proof read them before i give them to him but i am struggling to find any books ( or a book ) dealing with advanced things such as consent , different seuxalities , transgender people etc etc . please help  happy 
Ex3: hello r / feminism , we at r / indianreaders are celebrating ' women in literature ' , a whole month dedicated to women authors . every month we have a theme for books we read . as an endeavor to add more women authors to our bookshelves , we are dedicating this month to celebrate * women in literature * . we have listed a couple of books [ here ] (   and would love to add your suggestions to it . did you read a book written by a female that affected you profoundly ? did you make it a point to posses an entire bibliography of your favorite woman author ? share it with us  happy  p . s: thanks to / u / demmian for letting us share this with you .

Ex1: why are the hijab and niquab suddenly being presented as liberating or feminist symbols ? i can not remember who made this comparison , but as a middle eastern guy , i found this extremely true : saying the hijab liberates women and is a symbol of feminism is like a woman in the 1 9 3 0 s saying that staying at home without a job , raising her kids , and not going out without her husbands permission are feminist symbols and are liberating . it is very nice that her desires happen to fit with the status quo , but at the core , it is false . the hijab just perpetuates rape culture . the whole religious justification for it is that men cannot control themselves and women must cover themselves to compensate , a concept which is the antithesis of modern feminism . and it does not even work ! the fact that when my sister visits my place in egypt , she ' s too afraid to walk to the gym two minutes away without me accompanying her because men will chase her with cars and constantly harass her is a direct result of this mentality that is perpetuated by the hijab . obviously i am not saying that women * should not * wear the hijab . it should always be a woman ' s choice to wear what she wants . but when publications like the huffington post and western women start claiming that the veil liberates women and should be considered feminist symbol , it is an insult to all the women in the middle east and southeast asia who have been convinced that their bodies are too tempting for men to handle , and that rape prevention should be their responsibility . edit : for those who may think that i am in a place which is affected more by sexual harassment and rape most other places in the middle east ; i live in an upper - middle class neighborhood . this is a safer and more liberal area than most .
Ex2: if you do not wear heels your fired yes , the title is true . so i am a hair dresser in a big city . i am afraid to say where . i worked for the "" colourist of loreal paris "" for four years . i believed he would help my career . instead , after four years of working for him he randomly decided that i had to wear  number  inch heels ( as a minimum ) dress like a stripper , and that i had to lose  number  lbs . he use to treat me like a personal assistant and i would have to buy him condoms , lube , and illegal poppers . ( he was gay but hated lesbians . how the fuck does that make sense ) when i met him , i weighed  number  lbs , at the height of an eating disorder . after counselling and peer group help , i got over it and gained a nice  number  lbs . he got very mad . he called me fat at any chance . he also tried to make me wear heels when he knew i had s foot disorder where my feet were overturned . he loved to remind me that i had a very beautiful face but an ugly body . years later , he said heels or get the fuck out , i said i refuse to wear the heels until you provide a shock abosorbncy matt , he said no i am not spending the money on that , i said i am not wearing heels , and long story short he said i was fired . i know i have a case to fight with , but i can not give up my reputation in the hair world , please help .
Ex3: swimsuits - men vs women for my work i was told i needed to wear a one piece suit for a trip or else i needed to wear a t - shirt . i asked if i could wear my tankini with high waisted shorts to make sure my stomach did not show , and they still said to bring a t - shirt . why are men ' s abs not sexualized ?   if one strip of my stomach shows apparently the male population is going to get raging boners and not be able to control themselves . so frustrating .
Ex4: developing my ‘ femme ’ self without shame so , i ’ ve been a lesbian all my life since , i ’ m now  number  , but i ’ ve also been a feminist and much more radical ( not letting men or women get away with misogynistic language ) as i ’ ve gotten older , and i ’ ve been doing a lot of soul searching . in my youth , i was what is now called a lipstick femme , and i was happy ; then i got fat , got a job that is traditionally male , and forced to wear male fitted clothes for work uniform , and a few other things ( loss of self - esteem , loss of sexual relationships ) all conspired to put me in a position where i robbed myself of my own femininity . i ’ ve been seeing a counsellor and as part of that , a thread came up ; that i should re - discover and develop my femininity again , as surprising that has made me a fractured person . i ’ m writing here to ask for help and advice . how do i try and do this with all the body / beauty shame i have ? i feel ugly , i know i ’ m morbidly obese , and it “ feels ’ like trying to be the lipstick lesbian i once was is part of a mid / late life crisis and not attainable , but the arguments we ’ ve had in sessions show that she is who i am and how i want to feel , so after  number  years of not wearing makeup , how do i ‘ transition ’ without feeling uncomfortable or shame ? maybe this should be a cross post in feminism too , but i ’ m asking my lesbian sisters for some help . thanks for reading .

Ex1: was sexually harassed by children , today hey , so , i am not usually so confused about my feelings but today a group of four maybe  number  year old kids shouted that they wanted to eat my ass , etc etc inappropriate comments . i live in the city and i expect sexual harassment to be a part of my daily life but this was different . i am not enraged or anything , i am just so sad . like , who taught them that ? anyway , i will usually stand up for myself but i was so baffled and speechless by the situation that i just kept walking and i am not sure what i should have done . what are your thoughts on this ?
Ex2: i went off .   someone that i know personally was groped by a man in a college university . i ' d like to bring up something : to all the men that can assume they can do whatever they want or say whatever they want to a woman without their consent , fuck you . seriously , fuck you . you know who they are , and it might be the one reading this . do   not   underestimate the power of women . be a human being and do not harass any woman . and it ' s ironic , we have a new president sitting in the office soon . and donald trump has provided evidence that represents his radical sexism . if he becomes president , sexual harassment in america is going to be more common , and unfortunately , it already is to date . make sure you understand who you are really voting for . i have never been active on facebook ever but this needs to be addressed , and especially by a man of my age . i am  number  , and i despise the men that attempt to interrogate a woman ' s self - esteem . fuck brock turner and fuck all sexual predators . you guys are nasty low - life deplorables . now excuse me while i donate to feminist frequency and vote for the first female president of the united states .
Ex3: sexual harassment at previous workplace i left the job in  date  for various reasons . from time to time my mind wanders back to the appalling things that were mentioned while i worked there and i really want to speak up about it . keep in mind this is a veterinary practice owned and run by only one doctor , the accused . advice on steps to take ? i want him to pay for the disgusting things he ' s said to every female employee during my short time there ( only females are employed ) .

Ex1: seeking clinic escorts and reproductive rights experts in new york / newjersey / massachusetts hello ! i am a film student attending the florida state college of motion picture arts . this semester our assignment is to make a documentary . i am currently looking for subjects , primarily clinic escorts and experts in reproductive healthcare , to be featured . my documentary , tentatively titled “ the buffer zone ” , will discuss the impact of the mccullen v . coakley decision on the future women ’ s access to abortion and the role that clinic escorts play in protecting a women ' s right to choose . please let me know if you are interested in being featured ! it would mean the world to me . thanks !
Ex2: a film for the forgotten women of history ! hello ! i would like to tell you a little bit about my project . nessuno può portarti un fiore ( no one can bring you a flower ) is a poem in honor to women who fought for freedom all through out history , but for some reason they were forgotten . this reason is no mystery : gobernment policies across nations highlighting men achievements . strength is the element that allowed this women to carry on . being the source of this strength still an enigma . this work aims to change the reality in which this women lived and died , to bring light and clarity to their story so that , finally , we can honor them with flowers . we have started a kickstarter campaign , to be ready to film in december , i hope the project interest you , and you could help us whit a collaboration or promoting the project . here is the link       regards !
Ex3: moana vs . wonder women wonder women did not deliver a complex , independent , and confident hero . we were given a suppressed young women who needed guidance from her aunt to realize her true power , and direction from christopher pine to understand the world . yes , she went against norms by carrying a sword with an elegant evening dress , but that was out of naiveté . her only independent choice of the entire film was leading the charge against veld ( resist the urge to point out leaving themyscira was her choice ) . in contrast moana gave us a young women who was complex , independent , and confident . she defied her fathers wishes to save her island , and though at times she doubted herself - like we all do - she still maintained an air of confidence that she would be successful . her complexity can be seen through her competence with people , sailing , and overcoming obstacles . ( people need people . relationships help us better understand who we are . they can even provide allies in our own quests . relationships are vital to the success of any human being . ) moana needed maui to finish her quest , and maui needed her to restore his dignity . each could have accomplished the task without the other , but through one - another they were more successful . it wasn ' t the co - dependent relationship we are so used to seeing in stories , but the natural symbiotic relationship nature so elegantly exhibits for us . wonder women ' s relationship with chris pine was all about his hedonist desires and need to stop millions from dying . he offered to bring her to the war in exchange for her help off the island , than continued to string her along for his own help . he exploited her ignorance by constantly giving her a carrot of ares - though he greatly doubted himself . ( wonder women ' s whole life was controlled by others desires : hopefully part of her growth in further films sheds this ) wonder women was one aspect of womanhood . moana was the complete package , and should be used by feminists all day , every day . tl ; dr version : stop being lazy and engage your brain ( i . e read the whole post ) .
Ex4: what makes a film feminist ? so i bought my mom the dvds for scott and bailey ( uk tv show that focuses on two dcs in manchester and their boss who is not as featured . all women ) . i enjoyed it and thought she would too ( she does ) so we have been spending time together watching them . all the main characters are women . they are flawed , experienced , smart , etc . many common things happen to them that are part of women ' s lives . at least as far as i can tell being that i ' d probably be labeled a cis man ( never liked the term applied to myself , but find it useful as a general term ) . and more dramatic stuff that is not as common . all three women are white as is the majority of the cast . i am also a fan of a lot of horror . i tried watching blue me away yesterday and had to turn it off because of a sexual scene between a minor and an  number  yearold man . it ' s something i can rarely handle watching . the film focuses on the body horror / coming of age the main character , cis girl , goes through . i can not speak to the rest of the film due to stopping it . i find a lot of people in / r / horror define a feminist film as one in which the women are not sexualized , one dimensional , and / or are "" normal . "" an example is the descent which does not explicitly make a comment , say , about patriarchy . yet the film focuses on women who are all friends / sisters and one outsider who is friends with one woman . they are exploring caves , fighting monsters , etc . yet there is also a conflict over one woman having a sexual relationship with her friend ' s spouse . which could be said to be two women fighting over a man . i realize there ' s a lot of literature referencing this , but i am curious about how other feminists think about this in your heads . do you mull this over ? or quickly decide ? and personally , not academically , what you feel / think makes a film a feminist film ? i am not certain myself . i could say that a making a film where women are not generic archetypes is itself an act of feminist film making . i am wondering if this is changing now . or does a film to be classified as feminist have to be making a statement specifically ? does it need to be inclusive of other characters not in the gender binary and of varied ethnicty , skin color , class , etc ? .   what goes through your head ?
Ex5: casting couch in hollywood hollywood has had a casting couch for years , but it should not . they should cast parts based on the ability to play the part , both in acting ability and in believability for the part ( you can not cast someone in their 4 0 s to play a teenager , for example ) . other legitimate factors are availability – the actor cannot have another time commitment for another project during the filming schedule . these are all legitimate casting concerns . what should   not   be a casting concern is willingness to engage in sex with the producer , the director , the casting specialist , etc . for years , i have preferred independent and foreign films because they often offer better quality films than hollywood ones . however , the casting couch in hollywood has long been another concern . the casting couch also negatively affects the quality of films because then they may not cast based on who is actually best for the part . this is why i am frankly not at all surprised at the scandal involving harvey weinstein . he ' s a symptom of the problem , not the cause . fundamental change in hollywood is needed , not just the ousting of weinstein . without fundamental change toward a system based on acting merit , the casting couch will continue , which will negatively affect the careers of actors and the quality of films . is there something you the film consumer can do about this ? yes , there is . you can support independent and foreign films . there are high quality films out there that get overlooked . i started watching french films to help me learn to speak french . to my delight , i found that france creates some very high quality films . i do not mind reading subtitles . and with my french improving , sometimes i do not have to . of course , if it turns out that france also has a casting couch , i will be very disappointed . i hope not . i do not have a high level of confidence that hollywood will clean up its act , but i guess it ' s possible .

Ex1: is there such a thing as “ toxic femininity ” ? “ the concept of toxic masculinity is used in the social sciences to describe traditional norms of behavior among men in contemporary american and european society that are associated with detrimental social and psychological effects . such "" toxic "" masculine norms include dominance , devaluation of women , extreme self - reliance , and the suppression of emotions . ” are there behaviors that are traditionally feminine that could be defined as toxic ? can we define them and work to change them ?
Ex2: can someone explain toxic masculinity , and why it is being discussed . toxic masculinity is a concept i have hears from people shouting on the streets and in youtube videos about why men as a whole are a group of evil creatures . i have heard toxic masculinity described as the social norm of men expected to stand strong and not show excess emotions , and i have also heard about toxic masculinity oppressing women and being a choice of men . i think it ' s better to hear it straight from the horse ' s mouth .
Ex3: "" modern family "" what ' s your take on the show ? my so and i are watching modern family . before the  hashtag  me too   movement i was oblivious about .   basically everything . i never thought of this racism as a structure , feminism and stuff like that before , because well . it just did not cross my mind and without knowing i just accepted things the way they were . now i am rewatching the shows . i am so annoyed . it ' s homophobic , sexist , toxic masculinity and racist . i , especially get frustrated by the jay pritchet role . in my opinion he ' s old entitled white man who critises and bullies everyone because they do not meet up to his standard and his view on the world . and , he always regrets his actions in the end of the show . again , and again . and every comment he makes is demeaning and critising . i blurted out to my boyfriend that he was an old entitled prick and he of all , annoyed me the most . he thinks i am overthinking and that he is funny , nice and caring and much better than the overprotective mother of manny . it hit me , that he ' s still not enlightened and does not want to . and , i think that the majority of people still is not . i have tried to research on the show , but havent found much . what ' s your take on this very , loved and popular show ?   edit   : the homophobic / toxic masculinity : i am tired of everyone constantly commenting the gays in the show , they are missing manliness - all the small comments on how they do not fit in binary way of living . just because there are homosexuals in tge show , it doesnt mean that there can be a underlying of phobia and toxic masculinity . the micro comments are meant to be funny but in this constant amount i find it homophic and simply not funny . there are more "" homo - jokes "" and "" not manly enough jokes "" than anything else . both the gay couple and manny are constantly getting ribbed for not being masculine enough .

Ex1: hillary clinton :  hashtag  im not with her   i wanted to see what everybody has to think about hillary clinton . as a feminist , i find hillary to be a terrible candidate . let us start with welfare reform . as first lady she championed the slashing of welfare during her husbands administration . these cuts disproportionately effected women and children , plunging many of them into deeper poverty and perhaps even starvation . her foreign policy credentials are even worse . she has often been hawkish , voting for the iraq war , and advocating for muscular policy as secretary of state - - such as when she called for aggressively intervening in libya and syria . if hillary becomes president , this pattern of aggressive foreign policy is most likely to resurface . these policies have resulted in the needless deaths of countless women and children . as someone who has made the lives of countless women extremely difficult - - not to forget the ones she helped take away - - hillary is a poor choice for any feminist in my eyes .
Ex2: is it possible to be disgusted by both donald trump ' s claims of sexual assaults and bill clinton ' s history of sexual assault ? i feel like liberals ( including myself ) are not giving the victims of bill clinton the same kind of belief that we would to a random girl who claimed she was sexually assaulted . i find donald trump repugnant and i hope hillary wins , but i do find it extremely troubling that bill is her husband and she has stood by him despite bill potentially raping juanita broderick . why are false rape accusations decried by feminists when   mra   make them , but we call bill clinton ' s rape accusations false ? i do not get it . i am a feminist btw , i am not a   mra   by any stretch of the imagination .
Ex3: "" theresa may protest song ' liar liar ' hits no  number  on itunes "" - is the backlash against the uk prime minister objective , or is there misogyny in it ( as well ) ? this has recently hit the news :   is this reaction appropriate ( or should i say proportional ) given the context and the history of country ? i wonder how much of this response has elements of misogyny in it as well . [ for context : hillary clinton had plenty of problems of her own , but she was subjected to plenty of misogyny too . ]

Ex1: hey guys i am wondering if deadpool is feminist - friendly ? so i love comic book movies and i would love to see deadpool . the thing is , i get really upset when i watch movies / media that sexualizes / degrades women . i heard that in deadpool , he tries to get back with his girlfriend but there ' s a lot of sexual content ? meaning he ' s without his girlfriend , wants to be with her , is without her for most of the movie , but still there ' s and r rating due to the sexual content ? if someone who has seen the movie could let me know if it ' s feminist friendly or not so i can go see it that ' d be cool .  
Ex2: no , wonder woman is   not   feminist - it ' s insulting i enjoyed the movie on my first watch , until my sister made the following observation and it totally flipped the movie on its head for me : wonder woman is the most powerful woman in the world - but she literally cannot succeed until she falls in love with the handsome man who tells her how the world works . a reinforcement of outdated gender roles and female submission - all the more disturbing for being dressed up as a feminist win 
Ex3: anyone else seen the movie wind river ? let us critique it i watched this on netflix and was pretty quickly turned off , but finished it because the worldview reflected in the movie is fascinating . anyone want to debate / critique this movie ? my immediate reaction was this : it seemed pretty clear that they are depicting a us in which cities and governments exist in a cushy , human - made world of privilege ; this is made even clearer by the fact that the protagonist who represents this world is female . the writer ( the same as sicario ; enough said ) clearly wanted to have her make some blunders - - even though she ' s a special agent in the   fbi   , she often comes across more as an '   sjw   ' college - age stereotype who angrily confronts hardworking americans about matters she just does not understand ( speaking here from the perspective of the movie , not my own views ) . the male protagonist , on the other hand , never makes faux pas or blunders . he represents a masculine shepherd figure , defending the weak city folks . having come out only last year , i think it ' s no mistake the   fbi   is depicted as weak , feckless , and feminine in this movie . i will leave this here for now , and paste a quote in which the movie tries to draw this weird distinction between urban and rural life , making the claim that the metaphysical concept of luck does not exist in the country .   "" well , you know , luck don ’ t live out here . luck lives in the city . it don ’ t live out here . you know , that ’ s whether you get , you know , hit by a bus or not . whether your bank is robbed or not , or whether someone ’ s on their damn cell phone when they come up to a crosswalk , that ’ s luck . that ’ s winning or losing . out here , you survive or you surrender . period . that ’ s determined by your strength and by your spirit . wolves don ’ t kill unlucky deer . they kill the weak ones .

Ex1: what is your opinion on studies comparing men and women with outcomes like this ? recently , a [ post ] (   was made in / r / dataisbeautiful in which the grip strength of a sample size of around  number  people was tested . i am trying to have a better understanding of gender theory and feminism . i understand that stereotypes often lead to dangerous results and hold society back from fully accepting individuals for who they are . but i also think that there is some truth to dividing the olympics , for example , into men ' s and women ' s events . what do you think about this ? also , where do you think transgender athletes can fit into this ? just looking to hear your opinion , thank you .
Ex2: good women ' s and gender studies graduate programs in canada ? hi ! i am an undergraduate student studying in new brunswick , canada , and i am looking to pursue an ma in women ' s and gender studies . i am having a hard time finding any reviews / etc . of   wgst   grad programs in canada , so i thought i would ask here . my main concerns going forward in this whole mess of a grad school application process are : - i want to have a program that is largely course - based ( or has that option ) - have good ties to the community / opportunities to get involved , internships , etc . - takes an intersectional approach ( which i am sure most of them do ( or should do ) by now , but just want to stress this ! ) if anyone is in any   wgst   grad programs , or knows someone who is , please tell me what you think !
Ex3: gendered morality and backlash effects in online discussions : an experimental study on how users respond to hate speech comments against women and sexual minorities women who make hateful remarks on social media are likely to be judged more severely than men who make the same comments . this is also true for reactions to hate speech ( counter speech ) which when made by women are less accepted than counter speech from men . this is according to a study published in springer ’ s journal sex roles by claudia wilhelm and sven joeckel of the university of erfurt in germany .

Ex1: if you have had an abortion , what advice would you give to someone else who ' s about to have one ? i am putting together a zine on abortion , and i ' d like to offer a page of advice and experience from people who have had one . it ' s a pro - choice , intersectional piece , so it ' s not about shame or regret , though i understand that folks can experience that as part of the process . i know it ' s a sensitive subject , so i will publish all quotes anonymously .
Ex2: how can one believe in bodily autonomy   and   that cheating is wrong ? this is a legitimate philosophical issue i have been pondering . i believe strongly in a woman ' s right to an abortion for many reasons , but i have always felt that the most popular pro - choice argument ( bodily autonomy ) was also the weakest . basically , bodily autonomy says that the mother has the right to an abortion because she has a right to do what she wants with her body due to it being   her   body - regardless of the consequences of her decision on others or what others want from her , her right to control her own body is absolute . if you are to apply bodily autonomy as a justification to abortion you have to be pretty literal and absolute about it , because you are using it to justify the death of a fetus . so how can one believe that a person has the ultimate right to what happens to their own body ,   and   that cheating is wrong ? does not a person ' s right to their own body supercede their partner ' s wishes for their body ? yes , you can say cheating is wrong because it causes emotional pain , but so does abortion - in fact , abortion has more serious consequences for the fetus ( who is arguably alive ) than cheating does for the partner . note : i believe in bodily autonomy and a woman ' s right to choose , i was just wondering if anyone had any thoughts on this .
Ex3: against the new omophobic and anti - abortion italian government ! yesterday the new italian government has been formed after  number  days of discussing . one of the most rightist italian government of the last years , it ' s an alliance made by a center - right party and a party which , in the past , used to sustain the we should separate from south italy , and now sustain that we should stop accepting migrants escaping from war and starving . so , the new ministry of family declared ( translated ) : "" i want to intervene to strengthen the consultors in order to try dissuading women to abort . i am catholic , i do not hide it . and for this reason i believe and i also say that the family is the natural one , where a child has to have a mom and a dad "" . the current situation in italy , obtained after half a century of fight , is this : abortion is legal if made within  number  days , and last year we got same - sex civil unions ( still not marriage ) . we can not go back , we have to move forward !
Ex4: what ' s a good pro - abortion podcast ? so , instead of a final exam my gov . teacher wants each student to give a  number  min . presentation about a topic of their choice and i chose the history of abortion in america . two of my sources needs to be podcasts ; one supporting each side , and being raised pro - life i am not sure were to look . any recommendations would be appreciated . &  hashtag  x 200 b   ; on a side note , another one of my sources needs to be a book from my local library . any idea on a good read i might be able to find ?

Ex1: what ' s your view on semi - nudity on social media ? social media platforms ( especially instagram ) are full of semi - nude selfies posted by attention - seeking girls . as a woman i am utterly disgusted by this act . but at the same time i do not know what to think about it as a feminist ? because i know some people would argue that it ' s actually a feminist act , or i should not be looking at those images using the male gaze .   what ' s your opinion on nudity / semi - nudity on social media ? and the whole "" free the nipple "" campaign ?
Ex2: academic survey on the impact of social media on feminism i am currently writing my dissertation on the impact of social media on feminism , it ' d be great if anyone wanted to fill out my survey regarding their opinion on this topic >   it only takes about  number  minutes . also if anyone had any opinions they wanted to share here , regarding the positive or negative impact of our increasing social media usage on issues such as the awareness of feminist issues , legislation , community building etcetera , i ' d love to hear them . thanks !
Ex3: trigger warning ! my friend is glorifying and promoting anorexia on social media , and when i say it makes me uncomfortable she says i should be bodypositive and that she is healthy she is actively starving herself . she lost 2 0 kg in a matter of maybe 6 months ? and only eats few fruits a day . i do know bodypositivity is about respect but this issue makes me feel out of words to say . i can not get my head around the whole anorexia but bodypositivy things . do you guys have any thoughts ? thank you .

Ex1: doctor who doctor who has come under fire on here for the way the female characters are or have been written under steven moffat . some people have decided to stop watching the show . with the casting of the new doctor , jodie whittaker , have your opinions about the show changed ? steven moffat will be leaving his role as showrunner , to be replaced by chris chibnall , creator and producer of the critically acclaimed * broadchurch , * who has also written a few doctor who episodes , including *  number  , the hungry earth , cold blood , dinsaurs on a spaceship , * and * the power of three . * he stated that he always wanted the 1 3 th doctor to be a woman , and is responsible for casting whittaker as the doctor . she is the first woman to take on the role of the doctor since the show began  number  years ago . i think that chibnall will be a fantastic writer for the show , specifically in his treatment of characters . his writing for * dinosaurs on a spaceship * and * the power of three * stands out in how the female characters are written . amy was for many the epitome of moffat ' s sexism , yet in these two episodes , she ' s strong willed , independent , rounded , and really , really well written . this makes me really optimistic for his run on the show . it helps that whittaker is a self - proclaimed feminist , too . because of this , i think that chibnall and whittaker will be able to craft a strong female lead that may become a feminist icon for future generations . so , has the casting of jodie whittaker as the doctor changed your point of view on the series ? if you stopped watching , do you plan to check the show out again ? and if you have not watched doctor who before , has this piqued your interest ? thanks a lot for reading and god bless !
Ex2: character archetypes in fiction that are always a certain gender . character archetypes that are always male : - the grizzled war veteran covered in scars and tattoos . - the incompetent , lazy couch - dweller who watches tv all day . e.g. homer simpson , peter griffin . - the doctor who style chessmaster character who outsmarts their enemies and tricks them into doing the wrong thing at the wrong time . e.g. , sherlock , light yagami , l . - the comic relief character who ' s bad at everything they try and usually gives us laughs through slapstick . sometimes has a character arch where they end up being really powerful and competent . e.g. , beast boy , sokka , nevil longbottom . - any villain who has a complex motivation or character arc . e.g. , lex luthor , bane , mr . freeze . - the quirky , lovable , and slightly obnoxious tech wizard . e.g. the guy from live free or die hard . - the brooding anti - hero who constantly struggles between idealism and practicality . e.g. , malcolm reynolds , any protagonist in a film noir . character archetypes that are always female : - the seductive - but - deadly spy who uses sexuality to manipulate people . e.g. most female characters in bond films , black widow . - the damsel in distress who ' s really just a sexual reward for the hero . - the exaggeratedly tough - as - nails mary sue who wears glamorous clothing and makeup into battle . the strong female character ™ i really want to start seeing movies and shows that flip the genders on some of these . i honestly think that would be really interesting . like , imagine a burly woman in her  number  ' s , sitting at a bar and sipping whiskey with a giant cigar in her mouth . she ' s not conventionally attractive at all and she ' s got a giant ugly scar across her face .
Ex3: reactions to two movie trailers highlight the ubiquity of sexism : ghostbusters v . sausage party ( some links are   nsfw   due to language & sexist slang . ) i am sure many feminist stomachs have been turned thanks to the reaction caused by the announcement of the new ghostbusters ' all - female main cast . instead of considering that director paul feig has been on a roll when directing women in comedies ( [ bridesmaids ] (   [ the heat ] (   [ spy ] (   plenty of people were immediately and openly critical of the project . but because these people are aware that political correctness is a thing now , they have been quick to couch their complaints in "" melissa mccarthy is not funny "" or , later "" i am offended that leslie jones is playing a racial stereotype "" . there has also been backlash to the "" useless "" rebooting of a beloved franchise ( not that it got in the way of hype over jurassic world and fury road ) . even if there is some validity to these complaints , i feel like there ' s a substantial * outrage gap * that can only be explained by women being cast in the lead roles . their femaleness is not even treated as anything particularly special or noteworthy in the marketing materials , just like the maleness of the original ghostbusters team wasn ' t of much importance ( aside from bill murray ' s character ' s stereotypical lechery ) . this has not stopped people from referring to the cast as a "" [ gimmick ] (   which is an incredible piece of evidence that sexism is not even close to extinct . four women doing a task that was previously done by four men is a gimmick ; people feel totally   comfortable saying this . i do not have many great [ links pointing out the thinly - veiled backlash ] (   against the new ghostbusters project , but i think it was pretty compelling when sony attempted to calm the masses by releasing a statement that an [ all - male ghostbusters movie ] (   was coming soon . the weirdest fallout from this whole thing might be the [ argument ] (   that the all - female ghostbusters project is trying   to employ a sexism - based marketing scheme , because people will fear social judgment for being a sexist if they * do not * see it , giving viewers an extra incentive to see a controversial movie . * * what ? * * on the other end of the spectrum is the recently - released [ trailer for sausage party ] (   which is a raunchy comedy based on anthropomorphic , sentient food . the trailer looks to have a boat - load of sex - based jokes , which i am fine with , but the gender dynamics at play are absolutely nauseating . the male characters are all over the map in terms of personality , whereas the only female character we meet is a makeup - heavy bun whose only apparent purpose is to serve as the receptacle for our hero , a hot dog . she has a literal [ vertical smile ] (   maximizing the possible resemblance to a vulva , just in case anyone missed the joke . i checked the cast listing for another female voice , and it turns out selma hayek is playing a [ taco ] (   another character that appears to be an embodiment of female genitalia . i get   that this is a deliberately bawdy film , and i am aware that the main character is also a literal wiener - but since the hot dog is the main character , we can be sure that he will not only   be a sex joke and / or a sexual reward the way the bun character is . so we are presented with this tired , regressive , and harmful underrepresentation of female characters , and nobody seems to have a problem with it . the same / r / movies crowd that is so quick to point out the problems with a racial stereotype in the ghostbusters trailer has * no problems at all * with females being reduced to their genitalia via slang , sight gags , or representation as a literal receptacle for a phallus ( hot dog goes in bun - hilarious ! ) . [ the comments here ] (   are devoid of any reaction to this problematic element , which really points out how comfortable people are with women being little more than sex objects .

Ex1: gender stereotypes in family guy   family guy is an american adult animated sitcom created by seth macfarlane . the series has been airing at primetime for over a decade (  number  - present ) . the hit show centers on the griffins , a lower middle class family that lives in the fictional city of quahog . the show has made millions laugh but some of the material in the show is no laughing matter , especially the portrayal of gender in the main characters . the use of gender stereotypes in family guy can be inappropriate . we only got our evidence from one episode of family guy out of the  number  episodes , but there were plenty of example in the short  number  minutes . we watched season  number  episode  number  . let ’ s start of with peter griffin . peter shown as a fat , lazy , drunk idiot . the list goes on . peter is uneducated and because of this and his stupidity his job is on the assembly line in a toy factory ( where all employees appear to be men . ) . he likes sitting on his couch drinking beer and watching tv . he also speaks about how it is his duty to provide for his family “ as the man of the house ” . he has some nice quotes from this episode like “ it ’ s ok to lie to women , they are not people like us . ” next lois , lois is shown as nagging , housewife , always ends up condoning peter ’ s actions . in the show , she seems completely dependent on peter ’ s income as she is a full time mom for stewie . most of meg ’ s dialogue was her complaining about something . whether it was about her family or her own looks . she gets a cosmetic surgery when peter gets money because she only cared about her surgery and kept complaining about her lips throughout the whole episode . the other two main characters , stewie and brian , are a little bit harder probably due to the fact that they are a baby and an anthropomorphic dog . neither of them displayed any serious gender stereotypes in this episode ( they didn ’ t say or do much ) . these stereotypes can be pretty harmful when people interpret them too seriously and apply them to their lives . also they can be outright offensive to women and men as well . but that brings us to our second point . this show is a comedy . it is made to make people laugh and they do that by using extremes of stereotypes and animated figures . these stereotypes are so blatant that it is funny sometimes . it is a cartoon that points out the wrong in our society , and we need to keep in mind this as we watch most adult cartoons .

10,Education,"Ex1: sexism in school i have heard about a teacher who teaches biology in the eighth - grade . she asked the students to tell her what is typical girlish and what is typical boyish . and she really wrote stuff like : girls cook and clean while boys do not . and that only girls make up and this is so obvious so she did not write it down . what would you do ? i thought about writing an email to the principal . i saw the note of one of her students so i would call it verified .
Ex2: jameis winston again ( speech to kids ) i do not have the full speech but here ' s an article :   “ all my young boys , stand up . the ladies , sit down , ” he said . “ but all my boys , stand up . we strong , right ? we strong ! we strong , right ? all my boys , tell me one time : i can do anything i put my mind to . now a lot of boys aren ’ t supposed to be soft - spoken . you know what i ’ m saying ? one day y ’ all are going to have a very deep voice like this ( in deep voice ) . one day , you ’ ll have a very , very deep voice . “ but the ladies , they ’ re supposed to be silent , polite , gentle . my men , my men ( are ) supposed to be strong . i want y ’ all to tell me what the third rule of life is : i can do anything i put my mind to . scream it ! ”
Ex3:   bs ece   in may : grad proposal for electrical engineering ( women in   stem   figured you could share similar experiences ) "" too often the great decisions are originated and given form in bodies made up wholly of men , or so completely dominated by them that whatever of special value women has to offer is shunted aside without expression . "" - eleanor roosevelt my dad pushed me into engineering school ; it wasn ' t a major i contemplated until he told me he knew i would be successful at it . looking back at my senior year in high school and making one of the largest decisions in my life , i am appalled at the lack of mentors and teachers that mentioned engineering as a career path and when i walked into my first day of classes in electrical engineering i knew why : there were only about two other women in any of my major classes . i had never felt so out of place in my life and began to second guess if i was really in the right field . i thought of changing my major to accounting , math , nursing or even a different engineering principle with more women . along with developing this feeling of not belonging , i felt this need to prove myself to every other male student because i believed that being equally smart would not suffice . i needed to be better so that noone could ever doubt my intelligence in comparison to everyone else around me . this ultimately created my perfectionist persona with unrealistic goals and extreme anxiety . if i failed at anything or did not receive the highest grade , i became paranoid it would be equated with me not belonging in engineering school and this feeling was reinforced by my lack of confidence that i belonged there to begin with . though i still occasionally compare myself to others who i deem as intellectuals , i ended up with a selectgroup of classmates who i truly view me as equal in all aspects . i have learned to push away the feelings of insecurity and quiet the voices that tell me i do not belong in a male dominated field . my purpose of going into graduate school is to not only specialize in my major , but also to influence young girls to pursue their dreams . i am exceptionally interested in signal processing and acoustics . signal processing sparked my interest junior year and acoustics my senior year . first because i understood the material , but second because the way sound travels and can be modeled amazes me . i would like to continue to learn more about one or both of these subjects because the undergraduate material was a general overview and i hope to see the expansion of these material in future master level classes . along with wanting to specialize in electrical engineering , in the future i would love to be a mentor and give talks to young women about pursuing   stem   majors . my master ' s degree opens doors for me that would allow me to help young girls either by getting a doctorate and teaching or just going to schools and talking to women about careers and options that they may not have considered before .
Ex4: what sexist behavior or statements have   your   school teachers made through your school career ? i have got a story .   this happened in my ninth grade english class . it was an honors class keep in mind where everyone was academically driven for success . on the first day of school , our teacher was going through all the normal stuff you know , class expectations , course outline , until things took a turn for the worst when she began explaining the school lockdown procedure . so this is how it worked , we would all get in the corner of the room in the case of an emergency , farthest away from the door so no intruders could see in . however , not all  number  of us could fit in the given corner without some of us being seen . this is not the teachers fault by any means , it just means that in the very slim chance that something bad was to happen , some will be more at risk than others . she then explained that the formation of how we will be situated will be based on gender . the girls would be in the farthest of the corner , where they would be shielded by the boys who would be put as a barrier of protection between them and the entrance . so where does that leave the people who are inevitably seen from the doorway ? means that only boys would been seen . in the case of an emergency , she instructed the boys to pick up a form of some weapon , only the boys . her justification for this ? to protect the girls and to wield it against a intruder . not to mention putting the boys at risk of being shot up due to the fact that we could possibly be rummaging around for a weapon to use as an intruder enters through the door . at this point , many of us were simply laughing at how stupid this actually is . like cmon this in my opinion is just more plain ol ' stupid than sexist . when one of my male peers asked why is it like this , her response was that he should not have any problem with it being that since he is a male he should have the strength and ability to fend off a possible school shooter and females like herself should be happy that this tactical system is in place , but girls included were not buying it one bit . needless to say , this system was not used during the school year due to its constant stupidity . now that this story has been given , what other ignorant situations have you been apart of during your school career ? &  hashtag  x 200 b   ;

13,Sports / video games,"Ex1: violence against women in video games   so i read this article this morning and i am interested to hear what feminists opinion on this is . one statement that struck out to me was : "" should game developers consider implementing a gaming block that prevents players from attacking the female game characters ? "" as far as i am aware of feminism is the equality of men and women so would not denying the option to attack women in video games be sexism in itself as only men can be harmed but not women ?
Ex2: what are some great videogames that do not hypersexualize women ? my eleven year old son loves videogames . he mainly plays minecraft and lego marvel . he really likes the superhero games , but the ones i have seen are really terrible about oversexualizing women . i have had talks with him about this , and pointed out how the women are usually half naked and the men are not . the men are always leaders , smarter , more powerful . what are some great games that show women in positive roles ?
Ex3: women positively portrayed in games hello ! i ' d like to start of by saying that i have posted a similar thread in / r / gaming . but i feel like i should also ask here what you have to say in / r / feminism ! i am currently writing a paper about female characters in games ; more specifically when and how it ' s done right . i have plenty of examples of bad and degrading representations ( sadly , sigh ) . but sadly i only have a handful of examples where both women and men are portrayed equally . now i am looking for more examples of games which do it right , games that you feel made an impact or difference for you personally or on the gaming community as a whole . i hope you are able to help me with any input , also feel free to add any recommendations or notes you might have on this matter ! thank you !

15,Other Social Issues,"Ex1: sarah paulson on hollywood ' s racism to women   she mentioned that casting directors only considered her a romantic leading lady if she colored her hair blonde . if that ' s what they do to a lot of white actresses , can u imagine how much worse it is for nonwhite , brown skinned latin actresses , black actresses , asian actresses , native american actresses , etc ? they may say they are liberal , but hollywood is full of racists . here ' s hoping sarah wins an emmy as marcia clark .
Ex2: we have to listen to our black sisters   it ' s not enough to educate ourselves on these issues ( although that is a major step ) . we have to listen , organize , and stand with african american woman at all times . as well as recognize our privilege being european american woman a . k . a . white .
Ex3: white person wanting to better understand struggles   poc   have in modern day - where to start catching up on history ? books , movies , personal experience , etc . hi , long time lurker , first time posting , so i hope this is right . i grew up in a very multi cultural area . because of this , i always saw people as people , not their race . i used to think this was a good thing until i moved to a very white are with few   poc   and realized how ignorant i was to white privilege in general . my old town - white privilege wasn ' t a "" thing "" because there was no race ' larger ' than the other and equal ethnic groups owned local businesses and were the doctors & other important people . now , since all i see is white people , i realize the "" accidental racism "" everywhere like shoes that are called "" nude "" , few to none   poc   on radio , tv , positions of authority in the rest of the world ( the western world , that is ) . the moment that made me check my privilege was that nikki minaj / taylor swift thing on twitter when nikki calked out   mtv   for not acknowledging   poc   . i initially thought her comments were a dig at swift , even before swift replied to her . in the coming days i realized i was even more ignorant than i thought because i missed her point about race issues completely until other media explained it . i did not realize how much of feminism is white feminism and does not include poc or   lgbt   and i really want to educate myself so not to only see things from my white person point of view . are there any books or movies i can look at to get a better understanding of issues   poc   still face and more info on white privilege ? i do not want to be "" color blind "" anymore since that basically is living with head in the sand , but i can not seem to find a starting point to understand it . i make the mistake of thinking everyone treats everyone as equals and sadly , they do not . some people suck . i do not want to enable those people due to my ignorance . would appreciate any suggestions please - even trying to find books on my own about the topic i have seen pro white propaganda / anti   poc   material -_- * * * i am not from america , so things like ferguson & baltimore - i had no idea about the build up to that and still do not . i do not see violent racism , our police do not target black men , no k   sort of things are happening , but exclusion seems to be common . i do not understand the history , so do not know what i can do to make changes or at least shut down exclusion . any advice appreciated . thanks tl ; dr : i was "" color blind "" & realized recently that is just ignorance . want to know some history & current issues poc deal with that i can use my white privilege to help and get equality however i can .
Ex4: i have a critical question regarding representation in art and intersectional feminism , racial , and sexual identity ! first i want to say that i am a white male and i am also a comic book artist . i want to make a graphic novel that features a young latinx woman living in the city . the premise of the story is mostly undeveloped . the reason why is because i am a white male , i am unsure if it would be appropriate for me to represent the life of a latinx woman , yet i do not want to just make another narrative that features a white person as the main character . i plan of making the other characters diverse as well . but in that sense too , i am concerned that i may misrepresent the lives of women and people of color . i have done a lot of research on topics like orientalism and male privilege , which would suggest that i should not try to represent the lives of others because i have never experienced racism / sexism . on the other hand , there are just so many narratives that feature whiteness / white people , and i seek to upend that as the dominating narrative form . would it be appropriate for me to create this story ? if so what considerations should i take ? if not , then i will not go through with the idea . either way we can have a discussion on race and feminism in art !
Ex5: why i hate everyday feminism i thought i would do a post about why i hate everyday feminism . i do not mean feminism in general , i mean the website everydayfeminism . com . before you think i am a white man , i am not . i am white , jewish , female , who had learning disabilities and was in special ed and is mentally ill * *  number  . the concept of allyship . * * at first the concept of being an ally may seem like a great idea . but it is not . an ally is a term given by the "" oppressed "" group to someone privileged when they trust them . jamie utt wrote an article [  number  ways men can combat sexist entitlement in public ] (   i disagree with this article completely , but some women will label him an ally . he ' s not an ally to woman , he ' s only an ally to women who agree with his article . women are not a monolith . they make up half the worlds population , so how can you be an ally to every single one ? i can see the concept of allyship working in certain times , such as danish people or people who rescued jews were allies to jews during the holocaust . but it does not work today . everyday feminism recently wrote an article about resisting antisemitism . as a white jew i have never been discriminated against for being jewish . my dad who is from the soviet union and was discriminated there said jews are not discriminated here . i have never been stopped by the police , denied service due to being jewish or been redlined . yet someone commented "" we desperately need non - jewish allies "" . allies to whom ? if one jew or a group of jews labels someone an ally , are they also an ally merely because i am an ashkenazi . no . * *  number  . the term stupid is not ableist . * * while i have never been discriminated for being jewish or a woman , i have been discriminated by being placed in a special ed class . when carly fleischmann was  number  , she told her parents her therapists make her feel stupid by asking her to spell "" chips "" for a chip or asking her to spell her name . yes disability discrimination does exist , but the words * stupid , insane , dumb * are not ableist . the problem is everyday feminism decided those words were ableist based on a few sjws . they did not even survey the majority of disabled people other than sjws . instead they should address real discrimination against disabled people , such as saying "" everyone is a little   ocd   "" , the fact that children are segregated in special ed classrooms , or are made to learn the "" life skills "" curriculum when they can and are able to do the academic curriculum . * *  number  . some articles are stupid . * * ok , everyday feminism has a lot of great articles , such as how to support people with depression , endo and other conditions , racism and other oppressions , etc . there is an article called [ can asian - americans appropriate their own culture ? ] (   they are basically saying asian people can appropriate their own culture if they wear a bindi without realizing it ' s significance . what ? next they will say irish americans are appropriating st . patrick ' s day because they live in america , never been to ireland and think it ' s all about leprechauns . or black people from or whose parents are from africa can not say the n - word because their families were not slaves and perhaps their ancestors sold other black people to slaves . then they had an article called [ sociopaths , borderlines , and psychotics :  number  mental illnesses we must stop hating on ] (   just by reading the title you can guess what the article is about . * * they silence everyone who does not agree with their views . * * even if the person who disagrees with them is not "" privileged "" .

------------------------------

Ex1: literature ( online or print ) that focuses on the rise of intersectional feminism ? i know many first - wave feminists were accused of being white supremacists and racists ; the movement itself was regarded pretty racist . any recommendations of literature that focuses on the rise of intersectional feminism ? i want to learn about the transition of feminism ' s focus from white women to all women . i know , a lot of this is subjective but i am sure there ' s literature out there that will help me understand .
Ex2: question : is it alright for white feminists who experience more than gender - based discrimination to to identify as intersectional feminists ? i understand the importance of intersectional thinking , and do my best to consider the effects of gender and non - gender discrimination and their interactions . i know the important thing to emphasize here is the mindset , not the label , but until recently , i identified as a proponent of intersectional feminism . i did this for two reasons :  number  ) being able to identify as something "" other "" than simply feminist ( as the word has been misappropriated and often raises hackles , even for those women who desperately need it here in the south ) has proved useful in conversations with people who are unfamiliar with the reality of feminism . if i can establish some level of ' otherness ' it gives women a ' safe distance ' to explore feminism from . and  number  ) this label also allows segway into other important issues that people experience in society , such as racism etc . , which i feel is worth discussing . however , i am a white feminist . i do not experience the oppression that comes with being a   poc   , and my scope is limited because of this . is there a label that i can use that describes this perspective that also acknowledges my privilege , and thus , my limited ability to understand the complex underpinnings of multi - layered oppression ? also , if i were queer , not regularly abled , transgender , ( which , for the record , i am not ) etc . is it still inappropriate for me to say i am an intersectional feminist ? i am not trying to justify taking a label that does not belong to me , i am just trying to figure out where the boundaries are . these things can be complicated , and i want to be respectful while cultivating a deeper understanding of the issues . i have looked to the internet , but there are many contrasting opinions on this matter . thanks for the insight !
Ex3: on emma watson ' s skin whitening endorsement and panama papers what are feminists ' s opinions on emma watson ? is she a fake feminist because she is not intersectional ? she endorsed a skin whitening product marketed to women in asia . she ' s propagating racism . she was a part of the panama papers leak . her money would have helped british women on welfare ,  number  of whom could be the next jk rowling , who was on welfare .
Ex4: in crenshaw ' s seminal piece on intersectionality , what is a "" single - axis framework "" ? specific questions in body . in [ crenshaw ' s seminal piece on intersectionality ! ] (   what exactly is a "" single - axis framework "" ? is it the same as "" single - issue analysis "" ? of the court cases that she discusses in the article , are the cases of moore v hughes helicopter , inc . and payne v travenol examples of either concept ? a side question : in the time since this piece , does anyone know of a time crenshaw addressed the issue of endless possible combinations of categories creating infinite groups for protection ? she quotes a judge raising this exact concern but does not seem to explain why the judge ' s concern is baseless . perhaps crenshaw , or someone else for that matter , has explained how to determine which categories may be combined for purposes of legal protection ? i am guessing it would be something like any trait that is an immutable characteristic or already legally protected .
Ex5: is the intersectional feminist movement experiencing growing pains or destroying itself from within ? i was an enthusiastic attendee of the first women ' s march in dc , missed last year , but had planned on going again this year . however , i am now having second thoughts because of alleged antisemitic remarks from co - founders tamika mallory and carmen perez who are accused of saying that ( paraphrasing ) "" jews are especial exploiters of black and brown people . "" i know the third co - founder , vanessa wruble is jewish herself . this reminds me of certain intersectional groups on social media that are so full of in - fighting that it ' s hard to focus on what should be our real objective - - burning down the patriarchy . i believe conversations about traditional feminism excluding minority groups are necessary , valid , legitimate and important , but is it possible we are allowing ourselves to be too distracted by this hashing - out and losing sight on working together to achieve a common goal ? is the movement experiencing growing pains we must go through to become an even stronger coalition or are we simply tearing our own selves apart from within ?

------------------------------

Ex1: is this legitimate criticism of intersectional feminism , or does the author misses the point ? i have been reading these articles by a "" factual feminist "" called eva glasrud on her website called the happy talent . what i got from this article is that she does not like the use of the term "" white feminism "" as criticism of any problematic behaviour that other ( mainly white ) feminist do . that she ' s not a big fan of the website everyday feminism , and does not believe that cultural appropriation is a big deal . what ' s your thoughts and opinions on her view .     also her view on cultural appropriation       edit   : added more links .
Ex2: guy with a question about cultural appropriation i wanna start this off by saying , i am not an anti - feminist or a feminist and i am not looking for a debate about it , this is just something i have been curious about regarding cultural appropriation . my question is : if your child was interested in native american culture or history and wanted to get a headdress , what would you do . the reason i am asking this is because whilst i can understand that certain groups of people may feel strongly about it , i can not help but wonder if a child should not be allowed to do something because it may offend someone else . again , i am honestly not looking to offend anyone with this , i am just curious .
Ex3: cultural appropriation what ' s the deal with cultural appropriation exactly ? i get that if there ' s something of deep serious significance to a culture then turning it into a party gag is disrespectful , but i refuse to believe anyone can not wear braids because of their race . it ' s their hair for crying out loud .

------------------------------

Ex1: can a "" girls only night "" be a "" feminist takeover "" hello everyone ! i have a question , regarding views towards "" girls only nights "" . at a local club we had a so called "" feminist takeover "" - party in which only woman and trans people were allowed in . the reason for this party is to create a safe - space for women and trans people . so men were not allowed in . this club is a left wing club . and i had a argument with a friend about it , because i ( m ) think , that excluding men from a party just because of their gender is sexist . because this means , that every man is a potential attacker and could harm or harass a woman or trans , which is generalizing . i see how harassment needs to be stopped but in a different way . the club is already active in doing so , by having awareness staff around , where they stop men in case they do harass others and talk to the people about the issue . personally i can understand that ( some ) trans and women would like to have a safe space out of fear . but in my opinion just locking the "" threat "" out , but not considering that it is not a real threat is no solution for me . also this is happening in germany , where women are seen very equal compared to other countries / cultures . in the end there were only about  number  visitors compared to a few hundred normally . at least i think also that groups of people often go girls / boys mixed and do not want to go in that case . i just do not think , that this is a feminist act to do , and could be okay , but letting a person in or not , just because of their gender identification is wrong to me and should not be called feminist . i would be glad to hear your opinion about this topic , and maybe i am not understanding a few problems here , because i am male , but i even had a few female friends on this side of the argument .
Ex2: some stuff about gender and sex i hope people can read this in good faith and understand i deffs do not want to question how anyone identifies . so someone on another subreddit asked and deleted a rant about hating terfs for excluding trans people , and i had a response i ' d like to have a chat about . i also want to say that trans women are women and even if this conversation makes you uncomfortable because you want to support trans rights , i think we still gotta talk about this more , because   imo   theres a lot of confusion about sex / gender and how we relate with those , especially when transitioning . so here was my response to an "" anti -   terf   "" post . "" what i think is badly needed is a conversation about gender , how that relates to being trans , and how we can all live . many   terfs   exist and they need to be more sympathetic to trans women and accept them as "" real women "" , but there is also the fact that , as a feminist , trans people adhering to gender norms is definitely something i have questions about . i am not saying trans people are not valid and real and all that supportice stuff , but i think there ' s a huge amount of stuff within all this gender identity and sex stuff and screaming matches do not help . i dont want to unite against terfs who i can convince or understand instead . i ' d rather we all listen to each other . and yeah some people are juat assholes who do not want to accept other people , but i also think there ' s a real conversation about gender in there . ""
Ex3: anger in public spaces can somebody point me to sources that talk about the notion of anger , the politics behind its display in public spaces , especially through a trans feminist perspective ? thanks . trans - feminist here . inspired by black feminism , trans feminism . also is there a black feminism subreddit ? thanks again !

19,Reproductive Issues,"Ex1: if you have had an abortion , what advice would you give to someone else who ' s about to have one ? i am putting together a zine on abortion , and i ' d like to offer a page of advice and experience from people who have had one . it ' s a pro - choice , intersectional piece , so it ' s not about shame or regret , though i understand that folks can experience that as part of the process . i know it ' s a sensitive subject , so i will publish all quotes anonymously .
Ex2: how can one believe in bodily autonomy   and   that cheating is wrong ? this is a legitimate philosophical issue i have been pondering . i believe strongly in a woman ' s right to an abortion for many reasons , but i have always felt that the most popular pro - choice argument ( bodily autonomy ) was also the weakest . basically , bodily autonomy says that the mother has the right to an abortion because she has a right to do what she wants with her body due to it being   her   body - regardless of the consequences of her decision on others or what others want from her , her right to control her own body is absolute . if you are to apply bodily autonomy as a justification to abortion you have to be pretty literal and absolute about it , because you are using it to justify the death of a fetus . so how can one believe that a person has the ultimate right to what happens to their own body ,   and   that cheating is wrong ? does not a person ' s right to their own body supercede their partner ' s wishes for their body ? yes , you can say cheating is wrong because it causes emotional pain , but so does abortion - in fact , abortion has more serious consequences for the fetus ( who is arguably alive ) than cheating does for the partner . note : i believe in bodily autonomy and a woman ' s right to choose , i was just wondering if anyone had any thoughts on this .
Ex3: against the new omophobic and anti - abortion italian government ! yesterday the new italian government has been formed after  number  days of discussing . one of the most rightist italian government of the last years , it ' s an alliance made by a center - right party and a party which , in the past , used to sustain the we should separate from south italy , and now sustain that we should stop accepting migrants escaping from war and starving . so , the new ministry of family declared ( translated ) : "" i want to intervene to strengthen the consultors in order to try dissuading women to abort . i am catholic , i do not hide it . and for this reason i believe and i also say that the family is the natural one , where a child has to have a mom and a dad "" . the current situation in italy , obtained after half a century of fight , is this : abortion is legal if made within  number  days , and last year we got same - sex civil unions ( still not marriage ) . we can not go back , we have to move forward !
Ex4: what ' s a good pro - abortion podcast ? so , instead of a final exam my gov . teacher wants each student to give a  number  min . presentation about a topic of their choice and i chose the history of abortion in america . two of my sources needs to be podcasts ; one supporting each side , and being raised pro - life i am not sure were to look . any recommendations would be appreciated . &  hashtag  x 200 b   ; on a side note , another one of my sources needs to be a book from my local library . any idea on a good read i might be able to find ?

21,Political Issues,"Ex1: hillary clinton :  hashtag  im not with her   i wanted to see what everybody has to think about hillary clinton . as a feminist , i find hillary to be a terrible candidate . let us start with welfare reform . as first lady she championed the slashing of welfare during her husbands administration . these cuts disproportionately effected women and children , plunging many of them into deeper poverty and perhaps even starvation . her foreign policy credentials are even worse . she has often been hawkish , voting for the iraq war , and advocating for muscular policy as secretary of state - - such as when she called for aggressively intervening in libya and syria . if hillary becomes president , this pattern of aggressive foreign policy is most likely to resurface . these policies have resulted in the needless deaths of countless women and children . as someone who has made the lives of countless women extremely difficult - - not to forget the ones she helped take away - - hillary is a poor choice for any feminist in my eyes .
Ex2: is it possible to be disgusted by both donald trump ' s claims of sexual assaults and bill clinton ' s history of sexual assault ? i feel like liberals ( including myself ) are not giving the victims of bill clinton the same kind of belief that we would to a random girl who claimed she was sexually assaulted . i find donald trump repugnant and i hope hillary wins , but i do find it extremely troubling that bill is her husband and she has stood by him despite bill potentially raping juanita broderick . why are false rape accusations decried by feminists when   mra   make them , but we call bill clinton ' s rape accusations false ? i do not get it . i am a feminist btw , i am not a   mra   by any stretch of the imagination .
Ex3: "" theresa may protest song ' liar liar ' hits no  number  on itunes "" - is the backlash against the uk prime minister objective , or is there misogyny in it ( as well ) ? this has recently hit the news :   is this reaction appropriate ( or should i say proportional ) given the context and the history of country ? i wonder how much of this response has elements of misogyny in it as well . [ for context : hillary clinton had plenty of problems of her own , but she was subjected to plenty of misogyny too . ]

Ex1: sophie walker , leader of the women ' s equality party in the uk is doing an   ama   [x - post r / london ] hi / r / feminism , i thought you might be interested to hear about the [ women ' s equality party ] (   which is a new political party here in the uk . their leader , sophie walker , is standing as a candidate for mayor of london in an election on 5 th may . she will be doing an   ama   over in / r / london at  time  (   gmt   +  number  ) today . i imagine the majority of subscribers here are american , but hopefully there ' s a decent helping of brits too ! this is the new party co - founded by sandi toksvig , and they plan to be standing at further elections around the uk in the future . this   ama   will obviously be mainly about london , but i hope it ' s interesting for those of you outside our city too . hope to see you in / r / london .    
Ex2: i am very conflicted about my political views i have always considered myself a feminist , i am part of the lgbtq + myself and i always stand up for queerfolk . i do not want to be anything else but i am so fucking conflicted . part of me wants to join the hateful anti feminism crowd , i somewhat crave their validation . but i want to be a feminist too ! i want to be empowered and fight for what i believe ! i just do not have the courage so i hide what i believe in when i know the people i talk to will not back me up . i am very self conscious as it is , and i hate all political differences , but i respect the right to have an opinion  percent  . i am too ashamed right now to stand up as a feminist and queer , especially online . i am not confident enough to argue and debate , and i get super anxious when i even utter a single belief of mine . can anyone here even slightly relate to this ? or maybe i am just a bad person . maybe i just needed to vent this .
Ex3: how much is political corruption affecting progress on women ' s issues ? jimmy carter : the u.s. is an “ oligarchy with unlimited political bribery ” former president jimmy carter said tuesday on the nationally syndicated radio show the thom hartmann program : "" now it ’ s just an oligarchy , with unlimited political bribery being the essence of getting the nominations for president or to elect the president . and the same thing applies to governors and u.s. senators and congress members . so now we ’ ve just seen a complete subversion of our political system as a payoff to major contributors , who want and expect and sometimes get favors for themselves after the election ’ s over . … the incumbents , democrats and republicans , look upon this unlimited money as a great benefit to themselves . somebody ’ s who ’ s already in congress has a lot more to sell to an avid contributor than somebody who ’ s just a challenger . ""   is he right ? how much is political corruption affecting progress on women ' s issues ?

Ex1: the women ' s march in montreal - my experience wow ! yesterday was .   phenomenal , historical , herstorical , powerful , touching , rejuvenating and wonderful in so many ways . i may not live in the us , but the women ' s march was important for every single person and i am so proud to have marched alongside fellow supported in the montreal branch of the woman ' s march . i have a few thoughts and i snapped a few photos that you can find [ on my site here ] (   i would love to read other blog posts that people may have written about their experiences . thank you in advance for sharing your stories .
Ex2: how can the women ' s march supporters justify having donna hylton speak ? a woman who was convicted of kidnapping and torturing a homosexual man who was starved , burned , beaten , and tortured over a period of  number  -  number    days   was invited to speak ? !   i am no trump fan and there are plenty of issues women and really everyone legitimately have with him but how any group could knowingly invite someone who has done what this woman did is beyond me .
Ex3: women ' s march what went wrong communication - wise ? the women ' s march was a big success , more people went to washington to be involved in it than the inauguration of president trump , but i can not help feel like it could have been even bigger and reached even more folks . this is probably only because i feel a bit left out myself . i do not log into this subreddit every day , but it ' s one i subscribe to , so it does show in my front page feed , but so do dozens of others , so not every story comes through , and i do not think that ' s out of the ordinary . personally i did not see mention of the march until mid - week the week before it happened . i did not realize that there were local events all over until mid - morning the day of . i caught on to that because a ( male ) friend of mine went to an event local to him and live - streamed it to facebook . i am not a diehard who buries myself in feminist media , but i think i am kind of sort of keeping myself in the loop as best i can manage .   so i started to wonder why , if the womensmarch . com website went up in november , did i not start seeing anytihing about it until just a few days before it happened . one of the first mentions i saw was a news story about a group of canadian women being turned away at the border who had wanted to join in the dc march . when i did a google news search for refences to "" womensmarch . com "" i was unable to find much mention of it before  date  . .   so what went wrong ? why is it that i , and probably lots of others who would have at least considered joining a local march did not hear about it a lot sooner ? obviously from what i have seen in the media , the word got out to university feminist groups and   lgbtqia   groups , but i do not feel word reached a lot of others until very late . i am not criticizing , just hoping that if i put the question out there this movement and others like it will benefit from any follow up dialog .
