0,Dating / Flirting,"Ex1: **SUMMARY**  Women will tell you there is no chemistry. Or there is no click. But that's not the case. It's lust. You just didn't give them the *tingles*.  **BODY**  There is a lie often told to men after a date or before a date that sugarcoats real intentions and reactions. It's called there's ""No chemistry"" or we didn't ""click.""  But that's a lie. There is no such thing as chemistry or clicking. It's called lust. She didn't lust after you. It's that simple.  In TRP, we call that the *tingles*. Women want to call it chemistry or clicking. But it is all the same. It is the start of any relationship or hookup or interaction between a man and a woman. You approach her because you lust after her. She will go out with you and sleep with you because she lusts what you can give her.  To call it chemistry or clicking is nice. It puts a little bow on it. Women will wrap this up for you and hand it to you with a smile. It makes everything sound like it's a mental state rather than a physical state. You may come away thinking, ""Oh well I liked Star Wars and she liked Star Trek, so I guess that's it.""  No. You didn't give her the *tingles.* You didn't get the fluids in that vagina running that opens her up for more. It has nothing to do with mental. In the beginning, it is all physical.   To get more out of the lust and to get past the lust phase is why this sub exists. It requires that you work on yourself and make yourself into a man that women lust after.   Let's not sugar coat it and call a spade a spade.   Don't be a guy looking for chemistry. Be a guy looking for lust.  **tldr**  Women will say there is no chemistry or no click. But, in the end, it's not about those vague terms. It's about the fact that she does not lust after you and you failed to give her the *tingles.*
Ex2: Sounds crude but after dating many girls it's been distilled into this.  Since i've been in graduate school 10 out of 12 i've dated have been vegetarian, gluten intolerant, and or focused on feminism. I was in the fine arts, and it's much worse. I'd like to discuss what I think is happening to the younger girls/men steeping in sjw culture but right now I couldn't do it justice.  A friend of mine once told me, ""You may not want a girl who smokes cigs, but a girl who isn't cool with you smoking cigs is not a girl you want.""   Why i'm suggesting this test is because you can't always catch red flags when you're into a girl. When you show her the mad tv ""can I have yo numba?"" skit and she says ""I don't know why i'm laughing at sexual harassment but its funny"", it should be a big red flag. But you might just think, ""haha oh yeah it is, but yeah it's funny"" and move on like a normal person. But if you asked yourself, ""if she said that, would she try anal?""   Im being a bit farcical but i'm mostly serious. By giving yourself this scenario, or something similar, you should be able to assess the girl much quicker than 4 weeks down the road.   The best explanation I can currently give is that it helps you see much easier rather than waiting for the big red flags. This isn't actually about anal sex; it's about you picking up on her ability to be flexible, compromise, be open to new ideas. If at one point you mention doing something she says ""no i'm not interested in that... but I might give it a chance"" versus ""no, i'm not interested in doing that"". Ask yourself ""would she try anal?"" depending one what you've picked up from body language, conversation, etc. you should have your answer.   Many of you might not struggle with your ""picker"", but my has been jammed up for a while. Often they're single for a reason, or with a beta for a reason. With feminism on the rise all of this is likely to get much much worse. Victimized women are not strong women, they're pampered spoiled fragile women. Bye bye crude jokes because this younger generation just gets triggered. Find a girl who can laugh off the things you do she doesn't agree with. Maybe it's anal.   
Ex3: Dating apps are the new era of dating, but why?   Because sex/getting laid is one of the core needs of a human being. Companies are aware of this and set up their apps to make the maximum amount of money possible. Take Badoo for example. Companies know that hot girls get visited a lot, so what do they do? The more visitors a girl gets, the more credits you need to pay to be able to talk to her, but when you match with the girl you don't have to pay anything. But we all know that to get a HB8-10 girl to like you, you need to be at least in the top 10-20 percent. The moment the guy pays credits for the girl, he has already lost the battle, by doing that he puts the girl on a pedestal and it will be noticed in the way he talks to her. The guy expects something from the girl because he puts in some virtual credits to unlock the golden pussy. The girl on the other hand will be automatically disinterested because he doesn't have the right SMV. In the end the guy only loses money and the girl wins validation.  Conclusion:   Don't use dating sites that use credits as their main currency.  
Ex4: Hot girl i am talking to literally just said ""I don't date, i don't know how to date, men don't talk to me, i've never been asked out, i've never been approached at a bar"". She's a hb9, tall, athletic &amp; tons of fun.  Hot girl I dated for a year last year. Beautiful tall slender redhead, runner. hb8. Same thing. Never been approached. She had never even had a boyfriend except one loser in college. She used Tinder to meet dudes and had been on about 30 awful dates with unconfident and needy guys.  Beautiful girl I dated for 4 years before that. hb8 super extravert who loved to party. She's been single since we broke up. Her best option since was a guy who approached her through a mutual friend and despite having absolutely nothing in common she dated him for a while, because he was the only fucking guy who took a shot. She is lonely. She just wants someone to do things with and watch some TV and bang.  We have these ideas that hot women have high SMV and are in demand and approached all the time and have all these options. It's just not true. The only options they have are the guys oogling them on swipe apps. All of these girls hate swipe apps. They just want a man strong enough to come talk to them, and that doesn't exist anymore.
Ex5: Every date I go on, I make it an attempt to focus on ONE concept to either learn, field test, or solidify. Tonight, I verified how critical the notion of ""Always assume attraction"" is.  Met up with a HB7 via online dating app at a bar who claims she is an avid Christian and acts like she's a unicorn of family values (which admittedly intimidated me, hence the title of this post). She looked even better in person which immediately got me motivated to have a good time. Grabbed a drink at the first bar and immediately from the start, implemented calibrated kino; Resting my arm on her leg, poking her for high points in stories and jokes, playful shoulder punches, and seeing how long I could hold her hand. Got her talking a lot about herself and had good conversation. At lulls in the chat I held firm and unbothered by the silence, and waited for her to reinitiate conversation which, to my surprise, happened every time. Paid for our drinks (she bought the next round at second bar) and escorted her out.   Escorted her arm in arm to the next bar a few blocks away. Further small talk and calibrated kino escalation and I pick up on some IOIs I may have missed. When I withdrew my hands from her legs and arms she searched for them. When I bantered that I bet she can't stop smiling we stared at each others eyes and called her out for losing our ""game"". I realized that I had been talking more rapidly/pressured than I should have and slowed down my speech tremendously. At this point she became very fidgety and would not stop looking at my arms and hands. I figured that her attraction to me was at its peak, yet, only one way to find out. Easy kiss barrier was broken which transitioned to caressing, resting my hands on her inner thigh, and likewise her hands on mine.  Kiss her a few more times outside the bar while waiting for our respective ubers and she mentions how I was her first date in about a year. I don't believe it's true, nor do I give a fuck. What matters to me is that she has been a large step up from the former low value girls I was pulling as of recent. I had a great time, texted for logistics only, and realized the whole ""Christian"" thing was just a shit test. I didn't dread the thought of being rejected, nor did I feel the need to impress her like I have tried with many girls before finding TRP. Instead, I focused on myself having fun, and she was merely joining me on the sideline. Even if she does go to church every week, all girls, fat or fit, work nearly the same on the inside; They crave the companionship of high SMV males. Hence, I need to keep lifting and improving myself socially and in my studies to keep this up.   I feel on top of the world this week; Maxed my bench at 225 this morning, have a date with an HB8 tomorrow, another date with a HB7 on Thursday, and a date with the girl from [this](http://archive.is/2b9Yb) post on Friday. Sent her a brief text saying to enjoy the rest of her night after she let me know she got home safely, and she already is asking to hangout again. I can literally feel my SMV increasing from all the work I have been putting in, and for once, I am finally starting to see **myself** as the prize, rather than her.  Always assume attraction.  -RPD  Edit- Just as an update as I don't feel like making a separate FR with my HB8 tonight, ended up passing multiple shit tests, heavy resistance, and had a make out close. Hardest date yet but had great success. Thanks again for reading.

------------------------------

Ex1: The ""love of your life"" is a myth. Like earth being the centre of the universe, or us being the apple of god's eyes, or the existence of life after death. All myths we are so prone to believe because they shield us from the (otherwise apparent) horror of reality: the fact that as living organisms, we are essentially alone among other mostly self-serving organisms, insignificant in the grand scheme of things, and finite in time.  The reality in the case of ""love"" and ""relationships"" is that you current ""significant other"" is out there for herself first, her kids second, and some source of security third. She doesn't love you; she loves the fact that being with you make her feel good/loved/secured/protected/high-status, etc. And the day you don't make her feel that way anymore (which comes quickly), and that in the context of the list of priorities written above, the benefits of leaving you outweigh the benefits of staying, then she will have no reason to stay and rationalise that she doesn't love you, or ever did..   This does not mean that there is no chance of you ever growing old and dying together, it just means that you have no way to ensure that it will happen. And that if it does happen, then you've been bloody lucky.  Just like with the other myths, the only way to solve the dissonance between reality and your wants is to drop the delusion and face reality dead on. These myths are just myths; Reality is harsh; it's ok, we'll be fine anyway. Buddhists have been fighting the delusion of permanence for millenia, you can just as well fight the delusion of lifelong love. It just requires to repeat the mantra: ""She's not yours; it's just your turn; enjoy it while it's your turn"".
Ex2: The goal of today is to help you figure out queues and triggers so that your conscious mind can realize when your unconscious mind is ""falling in love"".(catching the itis)  It's also about making sure that the twitterpation you've caught doesn't affect the rest of your habits and social life.  You must keep it separate and in it's own hierarchy that is subordinate to your everyday routine and healthy habits.   What you want to do is figure out your symptoms.  Think back to the last girl that took a hot shit on you.  What'd you think of her?  What'd you say to her?  What'd you say to other people about her?  Did you talk about her often? How many times a day did you think about her? What words did you use to describe her?  For me personally one symptom I've caught privy to is that I will use words other than cute, smart, pretty to describe a girl I've got the itis for.  Another one is that my word choice becomes masochistically poor around the person.  Your symptoms might be the same.   Congratulations you caught the itis.  You're in love.  What do?   The most important thing you must do is critique her in your mind.  Continue to do this over and over.  Look for flaws in the physical, in the mental, in the social.  As many as possible.  The reason for this is when the itis sets on you it becomes very very difficult to do this.  I had a friend who was head over heels for a girl.  Talked about how beautiful she was nonstop.  Well months later he's got a foot in the door and he sends us a picture of her.  Tell me why we roasted his ass.  That bitch looked like a man and he was too charmed to see it.  Furious at us he went no contact for quite a while.  It's inevitable that you will ""fall in love"", but you must keep that piece of how you think about that person separate from how you view the person as a whole.  Have you ever heard people say things like, ""Yeah he's a good guy, he's just slow/smells bad/impulsive.""  It's how you should view girls you like.  Phrase your thoughts about her in your head in this manner.  It'll help you to keep a level head and reduce anxiety, because it'll keep her humanized in your mind and not goddess like.  Biology can't be completely beaten, but it can be controlled.  So how did you attack your own itis, delicious?  For shits and gigs tell us what's ugly af about a girl that charmed you lately.  Well she's super short, with a great body, but her teeth are more jumbled than a 7 year old's lego collection.  To be honest I don't even know how her teeth can grow like that.  It is ridiculous.  It look like her teeth got an outpost tooth on the lookout for plaque and shit.  There you go guys.  TL;DR Roast the girls you love and care about the most so that you don't build up an imaginary version of them that isn't at all a good representation of who they are.  Thereby keeping the pussy off the pedestal.
Ex3: Love develops after lust. If you don't lust someone, you can't love them. So what really is the value of love? It's just a bunch of chemicals formed after lower-level animalistic instincts. After you spend time with someone you will probably fall in ""love"" with them, I mean what else are you gonna do, punch them in the nose while watching a movie together, or hug? Love is just a bunch of chemicals that happen after you choose someone or someone chose you due to lust. There is nothing valuable or noble about love. So the people who say fucking escorts is ""not the same"" as fucking a girl who ""loves"" you don't make any sense. The girl ""loves"" you because she lusted you. She lusted you because of the body you were born with. Girlfriends/wives are either using you as a boytoy, to gain social status, or to enslave you as a beta provider. So there is no difference between an escort and a girlfriend. You pay for it one way or another; the currency could be cash, or muscle. If anything, people are more likely to work hard for their money rather than their body/physical attractiveness, so it is more noble to fuck escorts. An escort just wants your money, and a girlfriend only chose you due to lust, and, after spending time with you, naturally, had some chemicals kick in to make her more attached to you, but this is not any more valuable or noble than an escort's love for your money. LOL at all the blue pillers who think their gf/wife ""loves"" them. Absolute tools.
Ex4: Across the numerous media platforms that women infest to plug their egos into the artificial happy-juice pump, there seems to be a trend of virtue signalling and yearning for companionship via the domestic pet, often dogs in this context.  'I want to be the person my dog thinks I am.'  'Proud dog mom!'  'I just want love from someone like I get from my dog.'  O_o  What can we learn from this?  She loves her pet more unconditionally than she will ever love a human, especially a male (you shitlord).  Yeah sure, she will fuck you here and there, but make no mistake about it, she will never love you more than her animals, especially If she doesnt have children because: (drumroll, drumroll, drumroll....)  Women love children -&gt; children love puppies, and when there is no cuckspawn to love, animals are the next best option.  A woman can watch the news and hear about five people being decapitated with a dull chainsaw and not bat an eye, but the second it cuts to commercials and an ASPCA/Humane Society ad comes on, she flips the fuck out.  Gents please take note, forgetting the name of her poofy poodle or her precious little tibby-tat is on par with, or perhaps even worse, than calling her another woman's name while you're fucking her.  The quotes above in this post provide a clear picture that any effort you would make to 'love her the way her dog does' would be an exercise in futility of negotiation and inequitable comparison.  These women are so deeply invested in their animals that they are literally the Chads in their life.  This is even more true with horse-loving chicks.  They are all crazy bitches wearing chastity device-shaped beta sunglasses that fuel her hamster wheel with premium pellets from Petsmart to make her somehow believe that any man around her could never possibly usurp the alpha status of her stallion-in-crime (which she probably fucks in the stable from time to time.)  As Roosh once said, the hypergamous post-wall slag that somehow fails to never reproduce, or even get to single momma status, will use a domestic pet as a surrogate offspring.  The many nights she spends continuously without beta male attention/resources or being denied of Chads superior cumload, the more she realizes her lonely fate and tries desperately to treat her pups like they were her own children that she know she will never have.  Too bad they have a much shorter life expectancy.  Ha!

------------------------------

Ex1: Keep your game simple. None of this PUA beta bullshit.  I either drag a women home from the bar the same night i meet her with the ""share a taxi?"" line or i ask i women i want to fuck to come over and watch a movie. (Don't say Netflix and chill).   This is as basic as it will ever get and EVERYONE knows what it implies. If the woman says yes to sharing a taxi or watching a movie she is most certainly game to fuck. There are exceptions of course and they may change their mind but then you just cut your losses and move on.   Generally if a girl agrees to come over and watch a movie with me i have my arm around her within 5 minutes of starting the movie and move on from there.   Seriously if she agrees to come over she is interested (unless you managed to previously fuck it up by trying to be her friend).  You don't need ""game"" or the ability to read social cues or neuro linguistic programming or some shit. You simply put an offer on the table and see if she is buying.    Anytime a woman puts herself in a position where she is alone with you in her or your home it generally means she wants you to fuck her. I don't care what she says her reasons are.   I used to host a lot of parties in my house back in the day. I often got drunk and decided to sleep early. Two of those times i had women who i thought was out of my league come in to my bedroom giving me some bs excuse to sleep in my bed. ""it's too late to get a taxi and all the sofas are taken"" or whatever. I instantly knew they just wanted me to fuck them and so i did.   What i am trying to say is that you should ignore what you think her intentions are and instead look at the current situation you are in. If she put her self in that situation chances are she want's it.   
Ex2: I’m guessing I’m far from alone in this. I’m assuming many of us here were late bloomers. Late puberty. Late confidence. Late masculinity.  We never had the teenage life we were promised. Well the parties, drugs and general shenanigans were there but what our bodies craved most seemed an impossibility.  I think I heard young men entering nightclubs without Game knowledge compared to soldiers sent to battle with no bullets. I agree. Many of us simply got sick of being shot down. Unlike job interviews women don’t tend to provide helpful feedback.  I wasn’t the stereotypical nice guy that feminists like to construct. I was facially good looking, well dressed, had good career prospects, like to drink, played football and got into fights. But I never knew it was all a game. If I had the idealism would’ve disappeared and I’d have played ruthlessly.   I spent a large chunk of my young adult life avoiding women. The constant stream of painful rejections just wasn’t worth it. Then I read The Game...  Nothing has ever filled me with so much hope and excitement. I thought you either had it or you didn’t. And I didn’t. But no I was just the victim of dreadful parental advice and being a late developer. I used to beat myself up because I thought I was a loser. Now I realise I was a loser because I was so ridiculously hard on myself always beating myself up.  The Game lead me to Tony Robbins plus a whole lot of life experience culminating in reading The Rational Male last year which was as depressing as it was mind-blowing.   Now I’m thirty, well built and socially fearless. And only now do I understand the appeal of nightclubs where before they would bore the shit out of me. Speaking to women is actually enjoyable. Those cocky pricks were actually cocky for a reason. It really does feel great to have positive female attention. 
Ex3: There is an essential difference in how men see a game and how women see a game.  I remember when I was younger, and sometimes girls would join our soccer matches. For some reason the game instantly became a little different. We would all lower our standards and play it more ""safe"" so we wouldn't hurt them.  There is a great analogy there about the current state of the workplace. But I'm not going to talk about that here.  It was interesting to see how they saw the game. Differently from how men saw it.  Women were usually more interested in the relationships bewteen the players.  ""Mike just stole the ball from Zach"".  ""John just tackled me!""  And so on.  **For them the inresting part of the game wasn't the score, or a nice play. It was in the relationships between the players.**  This is a crucial difference in how men and women see a game. More importantly for us, the difference in how we see the game of a relatonship.  Men are usually more autistic. He will keep score in the relationship. He will invest and expect something in return. The harder he plays the more he gets. He will ""follow the rules"" and never ""play dirty"".  **The thing is... What most men consider playing dirty women consider just... playing.**  Shit-tests, emotional manipulation, taking sex and not giving something back feels bad for most men. They feel like they are doing something wrong if they don't clearly lay down the rules and take logical decisions.  On the other side, women like this because it essentually puts them in a position of power. When they know your real intentions they can try to reap from you what they want **whithout giving you THEIR real intention.**  This is why we so many guys trapped and emasculated in their relationships. They don't understand the ""real game"", the game of feelings that women naturally play. So they misinterpret many situations, and ""just don't get it"" their women's actions.

Ex1: **Introduction**  University research tries to reconcile the inconsistency between how:    1. Attractive women are *more likely to be promoted* because people tend to project positive traits onto them.   1. Attractive women are *less likely to be hired* if they include a photo in their resume. Attractive men, however, were more likely to be hired.  Then, the researchers discover there is a difference between the post-wall fatties who hire over at [Human Resources](http://i3.cdnds.net/13/30/618x647/obese-woman-sitting-at-office-desk-_preview.jpg) and the boss who promotes people.   **Body**  https://archive.is/O0n4J  Academia can be quite dominated with paradigms of patriarchal control, and so it can be difficult for them to see when women have societal agency.  A group of Israeli academics were trying to reconcile the seeming inconsistency between the bias favoring attractive people, but they were concerned how this bias was unbalanced during the hiring process if a photo was attached to the resume.  Attractive males were favored.  Attractive females were discriminated against.   &gt;For men, the results were as expected. Hunks were more likely to be called for an interview if they included a photo. Ugly men were better off not including one. However, for women this was reversed. Attractive females were less likely to be offered an interview if they included a mugshot. When applying directly to a company (rather than through an agency) an attractive woman would need to send out 11 CVs on average before getting an interview; an equally qualified plain one just seven.  Of course, they were quick to look at all the ways women were objects and victims.  They examined the “dumb-blonde hypothesis”—that people assume beautiful women to be stupid.  Nope.  Not that one.    Well, who is doing the hiring?  Human Resources. Gosh, wouldn't you know it, they're nearly all post-wall jealous women.  After a bunch of research, they were forced to conclude the following.   &gt; So the cause of the discrimination must lie elsewhere. Human resources departments tend to be staffed mostly by women. Indeed, in the Israeli study, **93%** of those tasked with selecting whom to invite for an interview were **female**. The researchers' unavoidable—and unpalatable—conclusion is that **old-fashioned jealousy led the women to discriminate against pretty candidates**.  **Lessons Learned**  Society struggles with giving agency to women.  Men? Lift, groom yourself, and be more attractive. Let that improve your chances of being hired over your tubby competitors.  The ladies in HR will push your application in the right pile. 
Ex2: The dating market is extremely competitive these days, and that's for a myriad of reasons.   Unfortunately, a few genetic defects can completely eliminate you from the dating pool, and these defects are hard to surmount. If you are in this group and you want to present yourself as an attractive individual, you must be punctual, you must be organized, you must have clearly outlined goals and you must be efficient.   Too often, guys who fall into the ""not sexually attractive"" group are circuitously pursuing their goal of being attractive. Let me give you an example of what I am talking about. Let's take a look at the short power lifter, who is deluded into thinking that power-lifting is going to make him attractive. This individual is hard working, consistent, disciplined and dedicated. However, he is not cognizant of what women find attractive. Women are definitely attracted to muscles but they are attracted to lean muscles. The short powerlifter is working very hard in the gym and pushing his body to the limit. He is sore all the time and his joints ache. He is truly putting in a good effort, but complains that women don't find him attractive. In this case, the reason that women don't find him attractive is that the powerlifter is muscular but carries a lot of fat. He spends too much time in the gym and not as much time socializing. His style isn't the best.   If this power-lifter truly enjoys the sport then that is fine, but if he is partially power-lifting to attract more women he should change his approach. This individual's efforts would be better appreciated by the opposite sex if he lost weight, focused on bodybuilding instead of power-lifting and went to socialize more.  Another concept to discuss is the idea of ""monk mode."" Monk mode in and of itself is a good conception. However, the entire idea of isolating yourself from society while you improve on yourself in the hopes of attracting women is contradictory.   A fact that a lot of redpillers fail to acknowledge is that women are attracted to socially adept guys. Being socially adept or popular is important to many women. The persona of a hard working disciplined guy *who does not socialize* is a turnoff to women. Remember that women think with their emotions. They want to be entertained. Hence, a guy who is so uptight and rigid is a turnoff to women because they won't be entertained by him. The exception to this rule is the group of guys who are so physically attractive that the women are already entertained by their appearance. But remember that these guys are not usually the guys who would consider monk mode anyway. So for those of you who are contemplating going into monk mode, you should accept that you need to improve yourself physically and mentally, but at the same time you should also consider improving your social abilities. These two endeavors are not mutually exclusive, and you can accomplish them together. Furthermore, more often than not, those who gravitate towards monk mode need to work on their social skills as well.   Time is an ephemeral commodity and you need to use it efficiently. For those of you who are struggling in the dating market, a good rule to follow is that women are attracted to tall, facially good looking, muscularly defined, well dressed, socially successful and financially stable individuals.   If your goal is to have more sexual opportunities with women, you should focus on improving the aforementioned traits. 
Ex3: So, this is my last real thought on my mind before I spend summer lifting, working, and focusing on ""being happy with myself"". Both are based of happenings in Highschool, which is the only place i get experience doing shut.  Rant: I consider myself at least a 6. I'm not muscular or built (yet), but my face is attractive, I'm funny as hell, and I'm not fat. This is the last goddamn school year I get denied by 3's, 4's, and 5's. I used to always think, ""if you can't get 8's, 9's, and 10's, settle for people less than yourself"". The logic being: they'll see that, in terms of attractiveness, I'm better than they are. Well, 2 years later and I was completely wrong. I read that one TRP post about less-attractive girls not needing to settle for guys who are their level or lower because there will always be 10's who they can chase. It's completely right. I've tried running game on some of the ugliest girls possible. Girls who have wack faces, no body, no figure, no personality. AND i'm still fucking denied. I look around them, and the other guys chasing them are 20x less attractive than I am, some more attractive than me (but very few), and they're getting denied too. I'd think ugly girl = easy game. Well, not true at all. So, First, I'm going to work on my body and my personality this summer, because I will not be denied again by girls who are less than I am on the 1 to 10 scale.  I will destroy these people. I will become so successful that I could buy their shitty lives twenty times over. I will have the money to buy them, their family, and their children. Then, even when we're both dead and gone, my wealth will still be enough to buy the generations that follow them. This, I goddamn swear.

------------------------------

Ex1: The whole idea is pretty much in the title.  Don't show your wealth to the girls you intend on plating. If they see you are doing well they WILL try to trap you.  This is even more serious if the girl is 25+ yo.  You will get more shit-tests, they will be more reserved sexually, more calculated and manipulative. You will get more headache than pleasure from her. She will try by all means to turn you into a BB.  If you have a nice place just fuck the girl in her house, or a friends house, or in a motel, w/e. It is not worth it.  Don't tell her your job or anything. If she asks just lie your ass off.  Guys that had to deal with desperate girls will know this by experience. **Desperate girls are crazy.** The type of crazy you seriously don't want to deal with. Not fucking worth it. Better just pay prostitutes than plating desperate girls.
Ex2: They don't know how to just be in the moment and enjoy things. They have to feel anxious that they are missing out something else. That's why they start to make happy moments unhappy by nagging, demanding, being passive aggressive etc.   It's like they don't understand the meaning of 'just chill'.  My plate has started to give me heavy hints that she likes me and wants to be more than my plate.  I've made it plenty clear that I'm not into relationships and we do other stuff like running, watching movies, dating etc other than sex and she's a good person and good friend, and I know that I don't  see her as more than that.   But she's starting to be all passive aggressive over small misunderstandings (timing etc), argumentative over buried issues, spoiling good times etc.   I've had bad relationships before where I was very cucked so I'm extremely wary of these signals and I'm so glad I didn't go down the 'I love you baby' route with this one. My younger self was a bit of a dumbass who said 'I love you' too easily.  Oh yeah. Did I mention that my *plate* is starting to hold back on sex?? Lol. Really, you think by holding back on sex I'm gonna give you committment? That would have worked for the younger, cucked me, but not for me right now. It just warns me harder to find other plates, work on myself and cool things with this one.  Edit: from comments below, it's becoming clearer to me that I'm the problem. I need to have abundance mentality and dial back down on this plate and look for more plates. There are plenty of plates out there and I should stop being hung up on one plate.  Edit: I started to apply dread and things are back on track now with me being top dog. However the lessons learnt in this thread are valuable. I can't do girlfriend stuff with my plates and expect them to not to get lead on. I gotta always my emotions, boundaries and frame in check for it to work properly.
Ex3: Seeking some advice. I went out with this... insanely hot chick for about 8 months, 5ish years ago. It was a lot of fun, but she was immature and it wasn't going anywhere, so it ended and life moved on.  I recentally broke up with my ex and guess who pops up a few days later?   After a few weeks of sexting, she comes over and we fuck and laugh and then fuck some more. We agree to keep it casual and I spank her on her way.  We message for a few weeks, her sending pics and trying to organise another meet up with busy lives and conflicting schedules. We managed it, or so i thought because she never showed. Last message I got was: ""Setting off, be there soon"". Then nothing. She didn't show, no explaination and has been ignoring me since, other than a couple of boring, short conversations.  Which is annoying, but whatever. Abundance mentality, I've got a few plates still spinning etc  I just want your thoughts on what made her her pull away and (more importantly) advice on how to lasso her back.  I've got ideas, just looking for some outside perspective/constructive criticism.
Ex4: Simple but good response I stumbled upon last night:  Hanging out with a plate and I made some half joking comment about enjoying something she viewed as very undesirable (as most people would). Anyway she gets all weird about it, saying “I like you but you’re really messing this up, don’t blow it, just stop talking.”  Old blue pill me might’ve tried to backtrack and say “I’m joking” or “yeah you’re right I shouldn’t do that.” But instead I laugh and say “you think I care if I ‘mess this up,’ what do you want me to pretend to be someone I’m not just to please you?”  She immediately started backtracking and saying “no you’re right I’m an asshole sometimes. I’m so annoying.” Then I give her some subtle signs of disinterest (e.g. turning away, talking to the bar tender, etc.) and she begins clamoring for my attention. Touching me, trying to be cute and funny, etc. Everything went back to normal and she fucked my brains out that night.  Not exactly sure what my point is other than stick to your guns. Hold frame. Show the ability to walk away. Don’t try to please her. You come first. She’ll respect that.

Ex1: **Summary:**  I know that we push this idea of women hitting ""the wall"" but something we don't talk about a lot is the morally self-righteous man who claims that he is so above ""sleeping around"" because he is ""mature"" now. The truth is, this guy has hit what I like to call a male wall which is different from a female wall, something I will explain in this thread.  **""Ya, I am so above getting laid, having sex, and dealing with women:**  First of all, let me say [bullshit](https://www.tetongravity.com/images/ci-images/44657/27067_the-sopranos-bullshit.gif) motherfucker. Now that I have gotten that out of the way, let me tell you why I said bullshit motherfucker.  As men with testosterone, we want to have sex. We don't need to have sex just like we don't need to have six pack abs, a fancy sports car, a nice salary, or any of that stuff but we want it. Just like that post wall woman wants the same treatment she got in her prime, a post wall man wishes he had the same success he did whenever he was younger.  Whenever a guy puts down ""sleeping around"" and looks down on guys that ""chase women"" as a means of sounding morally superior to them, the truth is that he either hit the wall or just lacks the ability to pull women.   Imagine Chad, he got so much pussy in his high school and college days whether it was due to being on a sports team or being in a certain fraternity. Due to never learning any skills relevant to dealing with people and just coasting by on his status, the real world hit Chad hard. Now Chad was clueless, why is it that the women in the big city won't get with him or care about his Greek Letters anymore? Wait, you're telling me actually has to try now? What is this shit!?  ""Oh that guy who is getting laid? He needs to grow up! There is more to life than pussy!""  We've heard it before, we've even heard it on here, and we've heard it a lot in real life. The ""grow up"" and ""be an adult"" card, post wall women play it as well as beta males but you better believe that post wall men play it as well. We can't really call them ""post wall"" men, more like ex-Chads or in some cases, they were just beta males.  The problem is, these guys just have a tough time accepting reality.  Now I will admit that some guys just legitimately don't care about sleeping around or having sex with women, but they usually keep to themselves and don't judge others. The guys that act like a moral authority or pull the ""grown up"" card on the other hard, judging the players who are getting action, they're usually the ones who I am talking about on this thread.  **Lessons learned:**  Most of the ""morally superior"" guys that play the ""grown up"" card are just angry that they no longer get laid as easily as they used to, or they never got laid that much in their lives.
Ex2: This post is expanding on a comment made by u/raisins3142  I’ve seen quite a few claims on the Red Pill over the years that extremely attractive girls (9s, and 10s) have done every degrading sexual act imaginable and are often the sluttiest. That’s not always the case.   Through my experiences with women, I believe that the sluttiest, most fucked up of them all are the 6s and 7s who are attractive enough to be Chad’s pump and dump, but not attractive enough to lock him down. Sure, Chad will take this girl home from the bar after he’s had a few drinks. She’s a good enough conquest that he won’t get ripped on by his buddies, but she’s not quite the smokeshow who he’ll keep around.   Here’s the thing: this completely fucks with a woman’s psyche. When Chad fucks her and never texts her again, the woman is basically being told, “you are not attractive enough to lock down a high value man.” After this happens, she needs to prove to herself that she *is* in fact attractive enough. So she hits the bars again and finds the next Chad, trying to confirm her own attractiveness, only to get pumped and dumped once more. It’s a vicious, repeating cycle driven by insecurity.  The 9s and 10s? They can pretty much have any guy they want wrapped around their finger, and they know it. They don’t need to go out and confirm their attractiveness by fucking some random guy. On the other hand, the 6s and 7s are getting guys with higher SMVs than themselves. These guys have options, and will continue to fuck other girls.   A few reasons why this is important: 1) That girl you have on the pedestal? She might not be a supermodel, but chances are she's been played by a guy with higher SMV than you. She has access to those guys, but she just can't keep them around. She's going to compare you to past guys in her head. Be Chad. 2) Many times, that cute looking 6-7 who you think is a ""good girl"" has had a train run through her by a scary amount of guys. It's happened to me before. Always just assume she's a slut so that you don't throw a beta-tantrum when you find out you're her 20th.  
Ex3: Far too often we hear the use of the common shaming tactics used when describing a 'real man,' or a 'real woman.'  Any time you hear this spoken in the context of intersexual dynamics, you should always question the person saying it, as it is a huge indicator of their intentions and relative SMV.  Real Men  The application of the word 'real' to a man's identity, whether used by a woman or a beta cuck, is solely valued on his utility to the opposite sex, as well as our capitalist society.  'Real' is in many forms contextual in these cases, as it is leveraged in the form of feminine interests.  - 'Real Men take women on dates and get the tab.'  - 'Real Men help with chores.'  - 'Real Men always put the child first.'  - 'Real Men won't have sex on the first date.'  - 'Real Men respect women and listen to/believe what she says.' (Includes sexual assault claims)  The above are examples that the Feminine Imperative uses to shame betas, and attempt to beta-tize the alpha, into undertaking responsibility and sacrifice for women's imperatives.  Keep in mind, to a woman, a man can be 'real' at one point, but not at another.  Example:  18 year old 6'5 Rugby star Chad doesn't treat highschool Tracy like a princess, never buys her dinner or answers her texts, fucks her roughly and blows his load in her mouth whether she's okay with it or not, and sleeps with many other girls.  Tracy loves this because he isn't like the other emasculated soy boy conforming feminists in her English class.  They aren't 'real' men like the dominant, masculine, preselected Chad.  But now Tracy is 35 and a single mom with 2 kids, none of which are Chads, and she keeps trying to reach out via facebook to reconnect and get him to commit.  However Chad is busy vacationing in Ibiza and pumping 18 year old vaginas full of cum and wants nothing to do with her.  He may stop by for a quick fuck when he gets back in town for old times sake, but will disappear afterwards.  Tracy hates this, and concludes that he is an asshole and not a real man (anymore) now that she is in her epiphany phase.  She then settles with a beta who does the 'right thing' and marries her after 2 months, absolves her of debt, and gets lights-off missionary duty sex once a month.  Her gfs and peers praise her for finding a 'real man.'  Real Women  The application of the word 'Real' to women is to artificially inflate their already low SMV to make themselves more attractive to high status men.  They may do many important things at their community book club, school, or have a PhD, but they know subconsciously this doesn't get them their desired sexually pair-bonded relationship.  - 'Real women are ambitious and educated.'  - 'Real women are strong, independent and don't need no man.'  - 'Real women know how to cook.'  - 'Real women suck dick.'  The examples above are primarily utilized by low SMV women during both their party and epiphany phases, and post wall career women who sadly have more humanitarian value to their jobs working 60 hour work weeks then they do for arousing a cock.  You will never see an Instagram post or internet meme with the above captions from a hot 22 year old, but single mothers, fat BDSM slags, and alpha widows in their 40s will do so without shame.  This is especially effective 'girl game' to ensure locking down a beta who has been sexually/relationship starved, but has no effect on Alphas because they know better and don't want women for anything other than sex.  You can't fuck a PhD, an empowering script written for 'The Talk' or 'Good conversation' from a woman who 'knows what she wants.'  Bottom line, the social leveraging of the word 'real' is a feminine interest to either modify men to their needs, or shame other women via virtue signaling to prevent competition for Chad.  Know where you stand when a woman tries to assign this label to you, or other males.
Ex4: We've all seen or heard of them at some point.  The chicks that love video games, watches football every weekend, is into kayaking, knows how to fence, knows the B-Side tracks of an independent a nu-meral fag band, loves the cult movies, or even likes to drink fucking Amstel Light...  You guessed it:  The HUGEST sluts on Earth.  Women don't have any real interests outside of the most vapid, veneer, basic bullshit.  'Muh Starbucks!  Muh snapchat!  Muh scented bath-bomb!  Muh phone!'  They all have this 'baseline' of attention outlets, consumption patterns, and things they make the slightest butt-sliver of effort to learn about.  So if you come across a woman with a unique taste in something out of the norm, you can bet the house that she had that awareness fucked into her by a Chad (s).  Women take interest in the interest(s) of the top tier cock in which they choose to ride with enthusiasm.  They are like water and take the shape of their desired containers, which is why she is attracted to men that lead and have a mission in life and don't text her 'love you babe' 6 times a day.  This is a simply part of her sexual strategy, and the more it fails in locking down Chad, the easier it will be for you to identify these red flags that are manifested in her ever-growing portfolio of unusual tastes acquired from belching up the latest Alpha's cum bubble.  Betas don't realize this, and will swoon over her unicorn-ness until she squashes their blue balls with her fucking Marilyn-Manson autographed superheels.  It's also important to note that the fact that these kinds of women have to resort to such character molding demonstrates that they weren't attractive enough in the first place to secure a high SMV man, so they have to become his shadow in hopes that her 'personality' and liking to his interests would be enough to keep him from straying and destroying the sweet sugar walls of younger, tighter pussy while she cries at home with a bucket of Ben and Jerry's while staying plugged Into the happy-juice pump (instagram) to dupe herself into believing she still has value in life.  It's one thing if she's been dreaming about becoming successful in one of these areas (i.e. sports or music) or has a long-standing interest in one of these areas/hobbies since she was a kid.  But if she's randomly ranting on about shit or knows something oddly specific about the said topic but cant speak shit to any other aspect of it, blow it in her face and plate accordingly.

Ex1: Guys, I love you, I love Red Pill. Here's my field report.  After two months on Tinder, versus Match, for ME I gotta say all this 'game' stuff works WAY better on Match -- for ME.  I loved Match. I couldn't believe how swell it was.   I had a ratio of 90/10 on first dates. No, not for sex, but heavy make outs, in her car or mine, usually and then after three dates -- boom!   It was a great pre-selection process.  But got off Match last year when I got an LTR. (From Match. A real honey, with a mouth that wouldn't quit, mmm hmm.)  So very recently,the LTR vacated my premises. All love and light on all sides, yessireebob, no bad karma around it, I still care for her, she for me, mm hmm.  Yet gone. (And I gotta say, I'm kind of relieved. I don't particularly love living with a lover. I like room mates big time and I like my dog. But not someone in my bed every fucking night. I like to fart. I like to roll over and pee in beer cans. I like to stay up till three watching PLATOON for the ninth time while I smoke a cigar and hurl dirty socks at my cat.  Tinder intrigued me. Seemed like a sure thing - pure attraction, yes? And, er, FREE.  Ten minutes after I first went on Tinder, BAM! I have a match with this hot 40 year old (I'm 52) and I'm thinking -- Tinder is the bomb.  Lordy!  But that first one?  Didn't work out.  (Ex-Mormon, Daddy and brothers fucked her, my goodness, it was an Arkansas family reunion and she was crazy from the storm, my droogs -- with an ex-husband fresh out of jail for domestic abuse (and an LAPD detective.)  Er, no.  And ninety percent of my Tinder dates have been BAD.   In fact, over the last weeks, Tinder proffered me a string of crazy bitches that you would think could not exist outside of an Adam Sandler shitfest.  So my question to you is: WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE ON THE TWO SITES: AS PER RATIOS OF GOOD DATES VERSUS BAD DATES?  I.e. For those of you who have been on both TINDER &amp; MATCH, what is the ratio of good dates (defined as hook ups, or immediate make outs, or just 'hey I had a great time with a non crazy psycho') to bad dates (defined as 'I wanted to eat my own sac afterwards'). Okay.  Here's my DATA RATIOS:  RATIO OF GOOD DATES to BAD DATES on Tinder: 10/90 RATIO OF GOOD DATES TO BAD DATES on Match:  90/10  What are your data ratios?  That's my question, guys. And any illumination you have to offer on why you got the ratio you did!  Thank you!  PS - I'm going on a Tinder date this Saturday (if she isn't imprisoned or institutionalized before then) and I'll give you a report.  But I'm ready to go back on Match.  I hope this was informative to my RP brothers, and would love to hear your own field reports.  Namaste, bitches! 
Ex2: My background 23 y virgin, discovered trp 2 weeks ago joined a gym and started doing pickup and tinder. This was my greatest success thus far. I know i'm very physically atractive, I have a deep suave voice and i'm tall. I'm balding but it's not that noticeable. My problem has always been my mindset. TRP is helping me change my conditioning and my life has been improving drastically.    Met a cutie on tinder, arranjed a date after she flaked twice (I just didn't next her because she seemed into me and was really flirty and hot) a couple of times. Later I realized she was scared of meeting some stranger at night (lesson taken) so I just set up a day date. Anyways I met her and it started to rain, preemptively I had an umbrella so she just grabbed my swollen bicep and off we went.  During the walk we kept talking about stuff like music and just generally boring shit so I tried escalating a bit and said I was a porno movie director when she asked me what I did for a living. I was looking for a star preformer I told her. She laughed it off saying it was quite the compliment. A couple of mins later I told her what I really did though. She studies the same thing I do so I guess it was some common ground that I really needed to find because there were a couple of awkward silences during our walk.   We stopped at this coffee house that was packed so I just took her to another place nearby and we got a couple of drinks which I payed for (she wanted to pay hers but I insisted, I know shouldn't have done this, it's still my bp habits). Mine was this long island iced tea (which looked really girly but idgaf) and hers was a caipirinha. We had a great talk I believe, she kept saying stuff we should do in the future which I see as a good sign. Overall she was really funny and flirty. I then switched venues and we drank a couple of beers (she paid for these) and then went to have dinner on this canteen because she wanted to save money.  I also ended up paying for this but because they didn't take her card.  After dinner I took her to this small pub and I knew I had to make the move because lots of time had gone by (3 and a half hours). I sat next to her on a sofa, put her hand on her thigh and kissed her to which she reciprocated and we ended up going out and making out in a street corner. I was about to reach down with my hand in her pants and she stopped me. She asked me if in my country we didn't tongue kiss (I probably am a shitty kisser) and asked me if I thought she kissed well (qualification? I said she did though). We walked to the river downtown and I held her hand but in a weird degenerate way like i was shaking her hand and she swiftly adjusted my hand (I'd never held hands before. And i know this was bp behavior again). Anyways we went to this park where we made out again, this time I was biting her, pushing her against a tree, pulling her hair and dodging her kisses and she seemed to love it, she seemed really horny. She asked me if I always take girls to the park and I told her, well, I never take them to the cantine. Also she asked me how many girls I've shagged and I told her a prime number (we both studied maths). She said, I can't have sex with you tonight because this is a bad week (period I guess). I said don't worry about it (fkn bp behavior again). Made out again and took her home. I kept groping her during our walk and had a raging erection throughout the whole night which she surely felt when we made out.   I texted her 2 days later saying ""when will we meet up again?"" to which she replied ""Uhh I don't know"". I'll try to meet up next week if she flakes I'll next her. 
Ex3: Threw a little party on Friday for St. Patty's day. In order to even up the ratio (which actually ended up skewed towards women, lol) I invited two of my plates who I didn't really value that much to come. As often happens, while I was expecting about 20-25 people to show, only about 10 people were around and 5 came later, so it was smaller and more intimate than I had hoped for.  They both showed up on their own, dressed very nice with black leather jackets looking good. As people were socializing I slowly realized that they were inevitably going to talk, and of course one of the questions would be: ""So how do you know cap1tal1sm?"" Now, one of them I met at a bar and the other Tinder, but I told the Tinder girl not to say Tinder, which she was totally fine with lol.    That didn't really matter. Despite my and my bros best efforts, they inevitably started talking and we confirmed that they both told the other that they met me in a bar. They **BOTH** knew that I was or had been banging the other.  That didn't matter either. When I got either one of them alone they were all over me, trying to make out with me and get me to themselves. I have simply **no doubt** that they knew they were only one of many girls.   *And they liked it.* Hell, they even shared an uber back together HAHAHAHA. Texting them afterwards they're as motivated as ever to hang out.  Someone mentioned in another post that the harem is actually the optimal situation to be in. This is a real, direct data point that confirms that suspicion. They *love* to be one of many girls competing for my commitment and attention.

------------------------------

Ex1: Tldr I realized I had abundance mentality and don't care if a girl leaves my life.   Today I was texting a girl and I asked what she thought of me. She said I came off as clingy. But when I thought about it, I realized that I was anything but: if she left my life today I wouldn't have a care in the world. This is because I have a full time job, go to school part time, and am communicating with other women. This was a big leap forward for me as in the past I would attach to one girl and be devastated when it didn't work out. The reason she said I was clingy was because I texted her too much and complimented her too much. All things which can be fixed. I have found an abundance of women by joining free dating sites including tinder, hinge, bumble, okcupid, JSwipe, and jdate. I also combine this with daygame on my normal routine.   Lesson learned: have an abundance of activities and women in your life and things will work out. 
Ex2: I thought I had swalloed the red pill. I thought I had cured my self of oneitis but I can't stop being a blue pill bitch. Got friendzoned by a oneitis, and the RP mindset was going great for a week, untill she started talking to me again. I could feel the BP screaming inside me, so I just walked away from her. And the thoughts started again, what if she just DOES like the new me? Deep down I knew I should't be thinking from a scarcity mind set, but I can't stop thinking about a random fucking girl who rejected me twice. Need help fully swallowing the pill, and finally defeating the beta mindset. I don't seek sympathy from this community, what I seek is help. My oneitis is best described as a quote in fight club ""she's like the scar in the top if your mouth that heals if you don't toungue it, but I can't help my self"". Recently I've been starting to hate myself for not being good enough, and on a logical level I understand these thoughts will only lead towards a shittier path but emotionally im wrecked. I wish to defeat my inner pussy once and for all. Bash me, call me beta, but know that atleast I'm over seeking sympathy. Only writing here because I won't talk to anyone outside these forums about TRP and I've recieved better advice from RPers that actual real life friend I've known for fucking years.
Ex3: I have dated many girls, and LTRed 2 of them, with each of which I was together for about 3 years. During my dating/plating/ONSing sprees I have made a lot of mistakes, like hitting on hot dumb babes and skipping decent looking smart gals.   When I was talking/texting to multiple girls at the same time, I used to put all of them in such a situation that with whichever I choose to push it further, they would be responsive. I did this to have an ease of mind and have multiple options aka Abundance Mentality. The problem is, I always chose the hottest one regardless of their intellectuality. This is a huge problem, make no mistake. As a person who identifies himself as an intellectual man, I like talking about deeper stuff more than superficial sex-related daily topics and gossips. But these HB8+ girls don't feel the need to really learn about or even be curious about smart stuff because they have pussy pass and they can get away with everything. AWALT, you might as well say.  A smart guy, be it a man or a woman, is always keen to learn new things and listen to those who are experienced. In relation to what I said previously, HBs are only interested in amplifying their looks and status and hence getting a pussy pass. Whether you are strictly sticking to ONS or looking for an LTR, empty minded ladies will make you feel empty at the end of the day. So next time you have to choose, choose the smarter one.  ADDITION: So since this post has generated a fair amount of attention, now is the time to reply to digressing and judging comments at once. Blame the digression on my incompetence at compiling coherent, story-like writings, can't apologize though since I'm not a writer by profession.   The italicized part is unrelated to the point being made here, and served the purpose of why I came up with this post; yet it generates the most controversy, so I deleted it. Nobody should care how good I am at fucking signal processing, this is not a resume and it's not a job searching site. But the HB8.5 seemed interested in talking at first since she was the one talking about tuning and frequencies; maybe I was boring, maybe AWALT, maybe if I was hot enough this would have an amplifying effect, etc. The point is, if the lady is decently hot and most importantly, more smart than hot, you will feel the most satisfied. Because if you fuck up like I perhaps did, it's more likely that you will be given another chance. Otherwise you will eventually feel drained for trying so hard to be fun and attractive. According to my experience, at least.  Lightly edited for clarity and taste.
Ex4: I’m gonna keep this short and sweet for you guys. No fluff or fanfiction-style overly descriptive sex paragraphs. Just my simple description of events and the knowledge I gained.    Back in high school I had severe oneitis for a girl (let’s call her Julia) and thought that being a nice guy™ was the way to win her heart. Obviously, it failed miserably leading to her rejecting me when I declared my love for her. We lost touch for the most part and a few years pass. In those few years I’ve gained probably 25 lbs of muscle, revamped my fashion, and have adopted TRP principles when dealing with women. All of these combined have made me a lot more attractive to them than before.   So this past spring break I was in Miami with a few friends when I get a text from Julia out of the blue. She saw my snapstory of me in Miami and it just so happens that she and her college friends have rented an Airbnb there as well. She invites me and my friends to go clubbing and crash at her house. We arrive at the Airbnb and I start flirting with a few of her friends. Not because I want to make her jealous but because why not. I could tell she was expecting me to be falling head over heels for her like back in high school but I really couldn’t care less. Yeah she’s still hot and all but I’ve fucked hotter at college.   We go out to the club, yadda yadda yadda, flirt and dance. I use TRP techniques like push/pull to make her even more interested. We all go back to the Airbnb. I scoop her off her feet once we get inside, take her into her bedroom, and we fuck. And while I’m fucking her I just start thinking to myself **“THIS is what I spent months and months agonizing over back in high school? Below-average pussy?”** Seventeen-year-old me would have creamed his pants if he’d known that a few years later I’d be fucking Julia with a fistful of her hair in my hand but all I was thinking was that it was nothing special. I think it was at this precise moment that I knew my viewpoint on women had changed for good.   I understand this is common knowledge to TRP veterans but for all the newbies out there with severe cases of oneitis listen up. Your mind is doing mental gymnastics to prove to itself that she’s “the one” or “special” when realistically there are 10’s of thousands of girls like her out there for you. TRP recommends going out and fucking other girls to deal with your oneitis because it works. Oneitis usually comes from a place of pussy scarcity so the solution is simple, increase your pussy supply by going out and fucking different women.   TL;DR: Get over your oneitis by fucking other women.   ---------------------  I understand I'm not really providing any new information with this FR but I think it's good to remind the newer guys on here of the basics sometimes. I don't claim to be an expert on TRP, and definitely I have a ways still to go. But when this happened I knew I had come a long way since my beta days in high school.

------------------------------

Ex1: **Summary:** I am a fan of dancing when I go out.  It is probably my favorite form of escalation; though it can be tricky to begin depending on various things (location, SMV, company, etc.)  These are strategies that have worked for me in terms of getting ladies to dance.  **Body:**  Have you ever been to a club/bar/locale and failed to enjoy yourself by dancing?  Here are some tips/observations that have enabled me to make the most of dancing on a night out.  * Find a place which has different music than the typical top 40 remix from a regular club.  Places that play salsa, cumbia, reggae, swing, and other atypical music usually have more people who are there to dance, instead of standing in a circle drinking with just your friends.  I personally love the sound of salsa so that's my go-to.  * These places usually offer a 1-hr lesson prior to the open dancing, for those of you who say you don't know how to dance.  You can take these skills everywhere.  I danced with a girl I met at a food festival because a salsa song was playing in the background, no prior interactions.  * These places are also good for practicing approaching for those who are not yet rid of the fear.  For some perspective, asking women to dance at a regular club works for me about 10% of the time vs. 99% at the salsa place.  It is a safe place for you nervous fellas to practice saying ""let's dance"" with confidence.  If you are at a mainstream club:  * Be loose, when you meet a girl and shake hands, groove to the music spin yourself around.  Most girls find this silly in a good way and will likely reciprocate when you spin them right after, boom, you're dancing with a girl.  This bypasses having to come up with some dumb intro in your head.  My success rate with this is about 50% after I spin her.  If it's going well after the first spin, I will throw in something like ""that was good, do it again slower"".  The benefits are many.  She is falling in your frame and she knows you are checking her out on the spin, which is good if she's already into it.  * If the girl you want is with friends (works best with 1 or 2), approach one of her friends and say ""may I borrow your dance partner real quick?"" eyes on the friend, hand on the elbow of your girl.  Girls are quick to say no when asked to dance by strangers, but they are more often willing to send their friends off with someone.  If the friend is cool with you dancing with the girl (which is the case more than I thought), the girl will be more likely to comply.  Sometimes you get some resistance from the girl (e.g. ""I can't dance"" or ""I'm with my friend"").  Reply with ""I don't know either!"" ""I know 2 moves"" ""come on it ain't gonna kill ya!"".  If said with confidence, that resistance is not too tricky.  The ""borrow from the friend"" strategy also has ~50% success rate in my experience.  **Conclusion** Location and music is big if you want to dance, select with thought, I've seen the dumpy men with a hottie of a dance partner because the guy is a master dancer.  If you are at a mainstream club, these were two strategies that have increased my dancing success substantially.  Tell me [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0OOmP_VMhI) doesn't look like a blast.
Ex2: This summer I realized that learning how to dance is more important than I once thought it was, so I decided to take one 2 hour ballroom dancing class at a community college.  At the class, the instructor asked us who do we think should lead while ballroom dancing.  Me and a few of the other boys said that the guy should take the lead while dancing.  A feminist girl I know objected quite vehemently, so the instructor  placated her a bit to soothe her hamster.  I got paired up with a black HB7 whom I'll call Maddy.  I decided that I would try to test out a few TRP theories, but I would not close the deal as she was too young for me.  While we were in dancing positions, Maddy tried to take the lead, but I wouldn't let her.  Because of this, she decided to try to shit test me a bit.  Maddy: So you think that you are going to take the lead without asking me my opinion?  Me: Yes.  Maddy: And do you think I'll be okay with that?  Me: It doesn't matter if you are okay with it or not, I'm taking the lead.  That shut her up for awhile.  She tried to take the lead again while we were dancing, but I overpowered her and gave her a stern look of disapproval and quietly but powerfully whisphered, ""No.""  We she started to get a hang of the moves, I said, ""You're finally getting it!""  And she would say in reply, ""No, we're getting it!""  After about 30 minutes into the lesson, Maddy said:  Maddy: So OP do you not think that a woman cannot lead in a dance?  Me: I'm sure that YOU could lead in a dance if you wanted to.  Do you want to lead?  Maddy; Oh! No, no, I'm fine with you still leading me.  After that encounter she was like putty in my hands.  She smiled and looked into my eyes the whole time through.  When I was leaving, I heard her talking to her friends about how I ""Crushed her soul.""  That comment brought a smile to my face.  tl;dr Ballroom dancing is a great place to see TRP in action.  Women don't want to lead, they want you to lead them.
Ex3:  I wanted to share my experiences how dance helped me to hook up more easily with some girls and how it can possibly help you. I think there is belief that dancing is beta activity  but if you use it right it can be pretty effective. So I will just point out advantages.  •	Escalating things physically much faster-you can pretty much eliminate prefuck conversations and  get a shortcut to the making out . I usually just dance with girl and see how she responds to little more wilder dancing  and if you have green light  just transition to making out and later fucking.   •	Your game can be little of-this basically comes from point one because you are practically eliminating prefuck conversations   •	You dont have to be pro to be seen like one- I dance salsa and bachata and you can seem very impressive for non dancing crowd even if you are not that good. Basic steps are easy to catch and with some spins it can look really good.   •	Showing skill and confidence- many chics actually dont know how to dance so from the start you are performing activity where you much better than her and most importantly you are willing to show her what you know   •	Sexual tension and plausible deniability- its easy to establish sexual tension and by dancing you give her plausible deniability so her antislut defense wont come into play cause you are just dancing right? ;) So thats all by now if you have some valuable experiences feel free to share.  
Ex4: **Summary:**  Invited HB8 I wanted to bang to come dancing with a group of mutual friends. She asked if her FWB could come. I said no, she came alone, we hooked up.  **Body:**  There is a HB8 who is close with some of my friends and she had shown many IOI to me in the past when I was not single. Being recently single, I put together a night where we planned on going out dancing at a bar, starting the night at my house with drinks, music, and card games. Told my friend to invite HB8 and to make it known I’m interested in her.  She accepted the invitation but asked if her FWB could also join the party. My friend texted me asking what he should say, since he knew my intentions with her. I told him to say no and to let her know I was looking forward to dancing with her.  I decided it would be best to maintain my frame and let her know exactly what my intentions are, and if she wanted to spend time with that guy over me that she wouldn’t be worth my time that night anyway. I wasn’t about to compete with some other guy in my own home.  After my friend told her no, she said that she preferred that her FWB didn’t come, but she needed a ride to my house and FWB offered to drive. We handled the transportation for her and had a great night, ending with hours in the bedroom and me getting very little sleep.  It was such a good time partying at my house that we didn’t even make it to the bar.  **Lessons Learned:**  * Maintain frame. If you have a DGAF attitude and let her know exactly what your intentions are it will work out if she’s interested.  * If you keep your guests entertained and taken care of at a small party (~5-10 people) you will look like a boss. I had a stocked bar, food, mixers, music and games on lock down, and the ladies loved it. The girls were all dressed up for a night out but ended up saying that they had more fun at my house and didn’t regret skipping the bar at all.  * Bonus Lesson: Preselection is real. My friend brought a girl (HB9) he was trying to hook up with but at the end of the night she was giving me IOI even though it was obvious me and HB8 were into each other. The next day she asked my friend for my number, texted me, and wants to hang out soon. Poor guy needs to start lifting.

1,Self Esteem / Grooming,"Ex1: You want something in life? Good. Welcome to the club. Humans are programmed for desire. None of us are without it. **We all want something we don't have. It's your mindset towards that desire that defines your life.**  So how do you get what you want? You need to identify *exactly* what you want. I advise writing these down. Be specific.  * Perhaps you're trying to get a job? * Want a promotion at your current job? * Feel like a new plate to satisfy your needs?  Give your goals a deadline, but still keep them realistic.  ""I want to be working full time in the tech industry in 2 months from now."" is a lot better than:  ""Get a job in the tech industry.""   So now you've outlined what you want in life. Great start. Now, **what are you going to do in order to achieve your goals?** The things you want in life very rarely find their way to you on their own. You need to work for them, chase them, dedicate yourself to them and take them for yourself. To keep with the goals listed above:  * No one will employ you if they don't know you exist. Put yourself out there. Use the device you're reading this on to create a resume and hand it out to different companies, whether they advertise as hiring or not. Most jobs down the track will come from networking and if people remember your name and face you're off to a great start.   *Lifting plug*: **Employers hire based on attractiveness** [[1](http://www.cornellhrreview.org/may-the-best-looking-man-win-the-unconscious-role-of-attractiveness-in-employment-decisions/)][[2](http://www.hofstra.edu/pdf/orsp_shahani-denning_spring03.pdf)]. Lift and become more attractive, confident, and assertive.  * Similarly, your boss isn't going to give you that promotion out of the blue because you've been working hard. He doesn't care about you, he's trying to save money for the company. You'll need to make it known that you're after the promotion.  * The plate won't find you. Girls want *everything* done for them. If you want a plate, you're going to have to find her. You have to keep her engaged. You have to escalate with her.  How will you achieve your goals? I advise writing these points down.  So you know what you want, and how you're going to chase it. Good stuff, you're on a path for success. ""This just sounds like a lot of effort. Why will all this work and dedication make me happier?""  *News flash!* It is a lot of effort. However, **working for something and getting it feels fucking great. It's rewarding, and you got what you wanted!**  A lot of people have an addictive nature. Whether it's to reddit, video games (I advise weening off of games completely), sex, food, whatever. **One of the best addictions in life is achieving predefined goals.** You get to shape your life into how you wish it to be, whilst enjoying the journey at the same time.  My only warning: **stay present**. Don't get too focused on the future that you forget the moment that you actually live in.  **Life is a journey up a never-ending mountain. It's hard, and most people stagnate partway up the slope. But those that persevere and learn to enjoy the hike are the ones that reach the top, and smile the whole way up.**  Feel free to send me an inbox about anything.  BWRS
Ex2: There are two views you can take on from this exact moment. Forward in time, and back in time.    In the first one, you look forward. Ahead of you, you see the infinite amount of room you have for improvement. The infinite amount of knowledge we have in this world to learn, and the infinite amount of things one can do. It's overwhelming.    In the second view point, you look backward. Here, you see the things you have accomplished. You see the people you've met, the great times you've shared with others. The degrees, awards, the status, and the tangible objects you've acquired along the way.     A moment of awe while looking at life's two views comes along once in a great while for me. I had one tonight after a major breakthrough in my career, something I have been chasing a long time.     It's funny, everyday, I wake up and chase my goals. I grind and grind and grind some more. It's been a long time since I have actually looked around, and being that I did tonight, I wanted to share this whole post with you.    When we are so wrapped up in what we are doing, we sometimes forget that we relentlessly punish ourselves. We push ourselves so hard towards whatever it is our end goal is, that we lose sight of everything else. And I don't mean any one pinnacle, I mean all things great in your life as a whole. We become hyper focused on reaching whatever pinnacles it is we set out to, that we lose this ability to calmly look ahead and behind, simultaneously. I think we shut that out for good reasons, it's very distracting. For myself, it's been the better part of two years since I last looked at the twists and turns my life has taken, where I am, and where I am headed.   I try to think what life would be like if it weren't this way, and I can't even put it together. But, I also see how fast time moves, and that shit scares me. It's almost as if I am judging my life's timeline based upon successes, rather than time. These small, short periods of looking from both views as I did tonight are how I am able to judge how much time has gone by. Not by my age, or anyone else around me. Because fuck age, it's a number, I judge my life by experience.    In moments like these, I feel detached from life most. I do because a sense of relief comes over me. That relief comes from knowing that I haven't wasted a single second of my life.    Every day has its struggles, things I must overcome, analyze, and make decisions about, but every day is rewarding because I have the ability to do such.     It's safe to say without the constant grind, I wouldn't have these calming moments to take in just how important living my life like this is. For those with a day where a single second is wasted, you will never know what this small moment in this blissful state truly feels like. You won't know what it feels like to know you haven't wasted even a fraction of your life.      ... And I pity you for that, because that's not living.    
Ex3: One of the biggest mistakes I have made in my life and I have seen in other men's behaviour is seeking validation. This is not limited to looking for it from girls but also from other men. It is proof that you have no confidence in your paradigm of the world.  Asking others' to confirm your opinions or views about the world is essentially saying, ""Hey I have no confidence in anything I have learnt or seen in life, please tell me how you see the world and I will copy that"". Lot's of young fall into this trap. And considering how fucking nonsensical the world is, it's understandable. But you are going to get nowhere in life if you keep looking for others to confirm your views on the world.   There is a distinction between accepting what you don't know about the world and looking to learn, and not believing in yourself. The first is a display that you don't know everything and that you are looking to expand your view on the world. The second shows that you can't even trust yourself. It is unattractive to men and women.   If you think someone has fucked you over, believe it. If you think a girl is messing with your head, believe it. If you don't trust your old friend, believe it. The more you believe in yourself, the more confident you will get in your own choices because you will start making the right decisions and gain a confidence you never had before.
Ex4: When you reach a point in your life where you are truly happy, when you are satisfied with the path you are on, you can't help but smile when reflecting upon yourself. A mirror is a literal reflection of yourself, and if you know you are achieving all you are capable of, you'll love what you see.  We are all on a path called life, and our final destination is a casket. We're born, we die, and in the middle, *we live.* **You only get one chance**, and you're the only one navigating.  Not happy? Make a change. Not satisfied? Make a change. Embarrassed? Angry? Sad? Not living up to your expectations? Make a change, **today**. Make a plan, put in work, **nothing will ever ""just happen"".**  A decade ago, I was an obese nerd. A homeless teenager, literally living out of a trash bag. Broke. No friends. No family support. I wasn't happy. I wasn't satisfied. I wasn't proud of the life I lived. Looking in a mirror, I'd cry, I couldn't stand what I saw.   I'm not ashamed to admit I struggled, but I'm proud to say I've realized my potential through work and dedication. I earned a scholarship to college, I worked my ass off (professionally and physically) to support myself and improve. I earned what I know I deserve, what I know I'm capable of. (I don't say this to brag, I say this to show that you can't be too far gone to improve.)  Only recently can I look in my mirror, in the house I bought, with the money I've made, using the education I earned, with the body I've built, and **love what I see**. I giggle because I'm so happy with what I've done. Fuck girls, fuck social media likes, fuck matches on tinder, fuck the opinion of others, **your approval, you happiness, is all that matters**. The rest will fall into place when you get your shit together. I promise that to you. It just falls into place.  It takes work. Nothing is free, nothing comes easy. Work is what will separate you from the unsatisfied masses. The gutters are littered with failures, and dedication is the only thing separating them from those stepping over them.   When that day comes that you look in the mirror and can't help but smile and laugh with joy at what you see, it doesn't mean you can relax, it doesn't mean you're done, it means you're found the right path to follow.  **Put in the work to find your path, and don't let anything stop you from taking the next step.**

------------------------------

Ex1: ( I fucking failed the title... )   **Ice-Cold laid-back alpha guy:**   Sharp, confident and relaxed eyes. Deep Voice. Slow talking. Doesnt talk too much. Talks more directly and probably is more honest. Keeps his sentences short. Never gets upset. Smiles only very slightly ( keeps his ""Brad Pitt"" face most of the time ). Doesnt laugh about his own jokes. Keeps long eye contact. Doesnt move his eyebrows a lot. Doesnt use his hands to express feelings or whatever.  This picture of Brad Pitt demonstrates this facial expression and the behaviour behind that well : http://s3.amazonaws.com/auteurs_production/images/cast_member/2552/original.jpg  The newest James Bond in his movies is also a good example.  I have no problem behaving and looking like that. I practice a lot.   **Enthusiastic Good hearted guy:** Very expressive look in his eyes. Moves his eyebrows a lot. Smiles and laughs a lot. Uses a lot of hand mimic. Doesnt hesitate to use a higher voice and talk very rapidly. Makes a lot of jokes, is always positive and talks about things in a very motivated way. Is very friendly and humble ( Not gentleman like though, im too young for that).  Look at this guy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qaeHsoIFn0  His name is Alpha.M. **Just a question on a side note**, would you call this guy just from how he talks, looks, and behaves an attractive and alpha man?  Look how he talks and the faces he makes. Always smiling, very positive and very motivated. Always cracking a joke and talking in a not-rude way. Doesnt have a problem in behaving a bit childish ( Is that good or nah? ) I may not talk as motivated and enthusiastic as Alpha.M does, but i am very close to it.   So **now** my question:  **How and why should i approach a woman one way or another. Why do you think one way is better than the other. ** **Which way am i going to have the better chances with. Maybe compare these 2 different approaches/personalities with yourself?** **What works best for you?**   **This is what i feel/think:**  **Laid-back Alpha**: I feel this one will get me more rejections, because people might not be comfortable around me.  But i also think, this will get me laid faster. I feel this will attract all the self confident slutty ( but hot) girls. So doing it the James Bond way.  **Positive gold hearted guy**: I tried out both approaches, and i feel this one will give me more numbers and will give me an easier time talking to girls. I always feel people feel more comfortable around me this way. People also tend to smile more. So literally doing it like this Alpha.M guy in the video i have linked above. But i also feel this will give me more dates than sex . I feel i would rather attract all the cute and nice girls, rather than the slutty hot girls. I also feel this will give me more dates and less one night stands and less making out. I also feel people will lose interest in me faster. Sometimes i feel, i just end up being the ""nice guy"" again. The funny dude who is cool to hang around with.  **Tell me what you think about this**
Ex2: When we look at the heart of frame control, we see the opinion of others and it's work against frame. But, the alpha is completely uninterested with the opinion of others. He does not look for reassurance from others.     Since I assume the population of TRP to be less than narcissistic... without a doubt, this lack of regard for others opinion comes with confidence. Because it comes with confidence, it comes with time, and the pursuit of proving yourself to **yourself.**    The alpha does not worry himself what others think about anything he does or decides, that is why it plays so heavily into frame control. It is not that a hamster lives deeps inside that works to justify this disregard. It is that he truly has his mind made up, and the way he is going about things is the way he decides, and that's that.    When he purchases a new pair of pants, he doesn't ask how he looks in them, he knows they look good. If they don't, he knows why. When he makes a choice about what he will do, he doesn't squint and cringe and ask, ""what do you think of that?"" He just does. He does because he understands life is about making mistakes and any backlash of criticism, is not only expected, but that he is able to recover from it, undamaged. Because everyone has an opinion, this is what every human forms. It is only the alpha that owns their own opinions, and disregards the opinions of others.    Because the alpha owns his own opinion, he is confident. Because he is confident, he owns his own opinion. He isn't concerned with the opinions of outsiders. When they voice their opinions, he may nod or smile, but inside he already has his mind made up. He doesn't need to ask what anyone thinks of anything, because he is sure of what he thinks about it.    **The alpha won't go out of his way to persuade others as to why they should follow him, this is validation in itself.**
Ex3: ""Alpha""  It's a meaningless term.  But what is it?    It's a mindset.  It has nothing to do with your body or your SMV.  Like your highschool coach told you when you missed 10 J's in a row in the big game... ""It's all in your head.""   So how do you become alpha?   It's simple.  Embrace who you are.  Are you an asshole?  Embrace it.  An artist?  Embrace it.  Into anime or some weird shit people will make fun of you for?  Embrace it and never apologize.  Fuck everyone else.  Live your fucking life.   Life isn't about what that faggot Chad says to you at a party to try to tear you down.  It's not about sitting at home and stagnating.  It's not about anything you think or do.  Life is literally YOU.  It starts and stops when you tell it to.  So live it or get the fuck off the ride.    edit** Shout out to u/thebeginer - thanks for the gold! 
Ex4: First off I think this post is painfully obvious. It’s actually a shame that I need to write this. But if I don't, you Blue Pill dorks are gonna be stuck in the Matrix forever. April 1 2018 is as good of a time to Red Pill you on the Red Pill as any. So here goes.  The Red Pill is a form on sexual strategy where Alphas like myself try to teach you Betas how to be less Beta. That probably sounds good to you in theory my dude. But did you ever take a step back and think maybe just maybe that Red Pill Alphas are Alphaing you?  I mean bro, why are you taking all of this information on good faith? You really think there isn't an agenda here? We're fucking Alphas. Of course there's an agenda.  Ever notice how the Red Pill tells everyone to lift? Why do you think we do that? I'll finally tell you because you losers haven't figured it out. Big burly muscles and [tan skin is associated with the working class](https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5348/7364622210_7a6b4b65dc_z.jpg). Obesity is a sign of royalty. All these false flag fitness posts are a trick to give you the body of a peasant while we Alphas hold the physical form of [big beautiful kings.](http://uploads.neatorama.com/images/posts/647/52/52647/1348193715-2.jpg)  Next ever notice all the video game hate? Go workout. Stop playing video games. Why do you think we tell you that? Because [the future is digital.](http://i.imgur.com/8fjQJl9.jpg) We want you to be as weak as possible in the digital world because that's the next frontier. Here you are wasting your life talking to girls, lifting weights and just generally being a retard while we Red Pill Alphas are decked out in epic gear, ranked legendary in Hearthstone, Diamond in StarCraft and win Fortnight on the regular.  Next let's talk about women. If you've read the Sidebar you would know that a woman is incapable of love as a man would want it. Ok. So why are you looking for love with women if their incapable of love? Ever heard of Sex Robots? Look it up loser cuz that's the future right there. Also ever notice how there are no guides on seducing dudes? Got you again loser. Men are capable of love unlike women. Yet here you are wasting your time with bitchy materialistic whores while we have [all the dudes](https://youtu.be/2nj4_oWzfd8) for ourselves. We have a saying amongst the Endorsed Contributor team: It's time to get excited cuz no girls are invited.  Next let's talk about masterbation. Yea we definitely got you with that NoFap propaganda. Ok think about it logically. What happens when a star no longer gives off energy? It collapses in on itself and becomes a black hole. So by tricking you into holding in all of your energy we know your gonna collapse in on yourself and become a Beta Black Hole Bitch. The more powerful a star the more energy it gives off. That's why powerful men follow the path of the stars and [masterbate constantly.](https://youtu.be/wM6exo00T5I)  Alright I think that I've revealed too much of the Red Pill [Left Hand Path.](http://alleeshadowtradition.com/eliphas.jpg) Not that it matters anyway cuz you're to indoctrinated to invest time into perfect your Cyber Strength, achieve a full figure, follow the Path of the Stars or learn how to give an amazing blowjob. A real Alpha would know when he's being alphaed by Red Pill Alphas. You're not and you don't.

------------------------------

Ex1: **Introduction**  The interaction between masculine and feminine polarity revolves around the opposing forces of **Freedom** and **Access**.  **Body**  A man's Frame is his internal Freedom.  To have a solid Frame you establish a perimeter around yourself emotionally and mentally so that access to your core mental state is restricted.  Frame is a kind of ""no go zone"" as far as the outside world is concerned.  It's your ego boundry.  Masculine polarity really begins with this partition as the boy becomes separated from the herd (women and children) and becomes his own man.  Women desire access to everything.  Feminine polarity is defined by it's ability to have access.  An ugly girl does not have access to desireable men.  So let's think of how this all plays out...  The man has a solid Frame and likely plays his Game to seduce a girl into following him.  The woman seeks access inside the man's Frame by attempting to **break** his ego boundry one way or the other.  If the Frame is broken the woman loses interest. (disgust)  The ideal state of affairs between men and women has the man being secure in a rock solid Frame which the woman cannot break while the man has access to the woman's emotions through Game so that he leads and she follows.  *When men and women demonstrate this type of inequality there is sexual desire.*  *Men love women, women love children, children love puppies.*  **Conclusion**  Freedom and Access are opposing polarities.  Men desire ego boundries and internal Freedom.  Women desire unlimited access but if they get it they experience disgust.  &amp;nbsp;
Ex2: Frame: every action you take progresses you forward some way. That is your motivation. For example, the reason I write for TRP is not to illicit a reaction from others, but to process my theories and flush out what I've learned from my life experiences.   This frame is inherently selfish. But even though selfishness has a bad connotation, making yourself the priority in your own life is critical to success and power.  Even when I help out a friend, I am doing it from the same frame. I am doing it to foster a relationship of mutuality and giving between the two of us.   Everything you do, you do because you want to do it. Because it will benefit you, either in the short or long term.  When you do something for someone else, you lose frame. Your happiness no longer comes from within, but from the whims of your target.  Lesson Learned: Your frame is that you are the one in charge. It is you who has control of your destiny. The thoughts, feelings, and interpretations of others do not matter to the strength of your psyche.
Ex3: ""Frame"" was always a tough concept for me to grasp. Literally took me months - mainly because I'd see it mentioned, read a little, not get it, and go do something else instead. But I knew I needed to grasp it.  Here's where it finally clicked.  Imagine you're literally carrying around a huge frame. Or a box if you want. That box is full of things you like talking about with a specific person. Hopefully, if you're talking to a girl on a date, that box isn't full of business propositions.  That's great, but that's where the magic begins. Imagine that you can only talk about things within your box/frame. The girl has her own box/frame too (BP pun there). Everyone wants to talk - the trick here is letting her talk about things...but ultimately bringing it back to what you want to talk about. You don't want your date to end up being about the prices at her hair salon do you? You want to talk about things that involve you flirting with her, getting to know her better, deciding if you want to pursue her, etc. In other words, your frame includes date things, and she wants to see if her friend frame can beat you out.  So the way I started to execute this is by imagining talking to a friend when you're really all about something. You know when you keep diverting the conversation back to your topic of the day. Think like that, just maybe a little more smoothly than you'd do with a friend (don't keep saying ""so when are we going back to your place""). But don't be derailed from what you really want to talk about, because you're ultimately being shit tested so she can decide if you're going to be a friend or a potential mate.  TLDR: Imagine frame as the intent of your conversation and try to keep it within that when interacting with girls. When it drifts, bring it back. Don't let your date turn solely into a talk about beauty products (her frame).

------------------------------

Ex1: If you've swallowed TRP, then you know how important it is to get your ass in the gym and lift. Assuming this is what you've been doing, you've probably noticed the wide range of women prancing around in skin tight leggings who put their bodies on display for all the hungry men in the room to stare at.  The gym is also a great place to see the effects of hypergamy in action. Have you ever noticed that if a woman so much as picks up a set of 2.5-pound dumb bells or goes for a walk on the treadmill, suddenly her standards for fitness in a male mate skyrocket to the stratosphere?  After hitting the gym and mostly chatting for 30 minutes to an hour, three times a week, and surviving on a diet consisting mostly of sugary Starbucks drinks, cheese fries and alcohol, she now feels entitled to a 6'+ 200+ pound male with 6% body fat who bench presses 350 pounds, and she is unlikely to entertain a suitor who doesn't meet these ridiculous expectations (unless of course your game is air-tight and you can deal with her shit-tests/maintain frame.)  The gym might seem a great place to meet women but because the effects of unrestrained hypergamy are in full swing in this sort of environment, you had better be the fittest, leanest, strongest guy in the room if you expect to dominate the competition.  You might think that the fact that you're in much better shape than her will automatically make you good enough, but that just isn't the reality. Similarly, you might think because your lame office jobs pays you more than that cute waitress, you automatically make enough money to impress her, but that just isn't the case. That waitress still sees herself as worthy of a 6-figure earner, and that girl in the leggings with the big ass doing cable kick-backs and unweighted squats still sees herself as worthy of Adonis himself.  It's the same with wit, charm, popularity (social proof), facial structure, etc. Women feel entitled to men who are vastly superior to themselves in at least some attributes.  As men we need to find an area that sets ourselves apart from the competition. A niche where we can be the alpha and occupy the top of a dominance hierarchy. If looks are going to be your niche, you had better have the facial structure of a male model. If career success is going to be your niche, you had better be out-earning 99% of the people in your field.  If fitness is going to be your niche, you had better have the body of a Greek god, and you should probably consider taking steroids because your competition is willing to do what it takes to beat you, even if you're not. That guy at the gym who's obviously on roids? Most women are too stupid to know that. They just think he works harder than you.  The niches I've just mentioned have a LOT of competition, so you had better be willing to do what it takes to win if you want to be competitive. If not, you need to find a niche that isn't occupied by so many people. Find your own brand of alpha; be the salty pirate king or the Italian kitchen emperor. Find what works for you. Find the niche that's suited to your unique talents and dominate it.  I'm not saying you should give up lifting; by all means, continue, but maybe re-consider those flexing shirtless Tinder photos if your physique isn't God-like, because if fitness is going to be your brand of alpha, get in line because the competition is fierce and she's already swiped left on two dozen guys with similar photos by the time she looks at yours.
Ex2: **Summary**  Leave the chit chat for social gatherings. Places like your local watering hole. *NOT* the gym.    **Body**  Just minding my own business moving weights at my clubhouse gym, listening to heavy metal. Why I specifically mention clubhouse gym is to be explained later.   There's this HB6 chick, let's call her Asian, doing some core workouts. This dude, let's call him Glasses (I think his glasses look wonky), comes in and he realises Asian is at the gym as well.    The first thing he does wasn't setting up his first exercise. He goes up to her and states  &gt;Hey, I haven't seen you at the gym the past week.   They seem to know eachother prior this gym session. Honestly, he probably only comes to 'gym', because Asian gyms here as well. Mind you, sure you can nod and say hi to your pals or gals at the gym when you enter. But he hangs around her for a good 5 minutes before setting up his first exercise (Being triceps pull-down). Everytime he finished a half-assed set, he would go up to Asian to chit chat for 5-10 minutes before doing another set. It took him literally 25+ mins to finish 4 sets of LAT PULLDOWNS. Bro.    Because it's a random clubhouse gym, it's fucking small with minimal machines. Therefore, they were always no more than a 5+ meters radius from me. After a set, I switched off my music for a second to hear what kind of conversation Glasses was trying to chat up with Asian. Surprise surprise. He was complaining about his day at his work.    **Lessons learned**  * Your time is priceless. Aim to maximise the amount of weights moved within the least possible amount of time * Save your chitchat/game at your local watering hole. Not the gym * Never complain to a woman   Td;lr Don't be Glasses  Edit: Formatting
Ex3: I have been lifting for well over 3 decades and maintain a strong physique even at  almost 50.  I have tried almost everything but now find that very heavy compound lifts are tough on my joints.  I lift every other day, but focus on a bit lighter weight, higher reps, perfect form and variations in speed of movement.   The exercise I find to be the most effective and challenging is the farmer's walk.  Farmer's Walks work the entire body, but particularly the muscles of the forearms, the traps and the calves. However, the core and the back are also engaged.  One can opt for very heavy weights for short distances or lighter weights for longer trips. One can also vary walking speed to stress the body in different ways. I have used specialized equipment for heavier walks and dumbbells for lighter ones.  Yesterday I filled two 5 gallon buckets with rocks, probably about 80-90lbs in each bucket and walked up and down my steep driveway, sitting them down only to catch my breath. After about 25 minutes I was exhausted.   Some of my buddies employ them as augmentations of pre-existing workouts, but I do them once or twice a week for about 30 minutes as my sole workout for the day, using the aforementioned variations.   They really change your body and you will finally be able to bring in all the groceries in one trip.

Ex1: **Summary:**  Why invest in women when all you need is a womb?   **Body:** Hello TRP.  Something has been on mind mind lately.  This sub dose not suffer from a lack of advice along the form of: whatever you do, do not get married.  If you you simply must, whatever you do, don't do it without a prenup.  And even if you get a prenup, whatever you do, do NOT get her pregnant.  Sage advice, both practical and true.   But, it has to be said, that for those with an honest interest in both children and traditional family, this makes for something of a conundrum.  Herein lies my thesis, attempting to reconcile these seemingly, irrational and self-destructive pursuits with the cold litigation-proneness of everyday reality.  Is a relationship, or god forbid, marriage, really a necessary part of this equation?  While women have *in-vitro* fertilization, men suffer from a distinct absence of reproductive independence.  Even with the absence of artificial wombs, removing a woman's uterus without permission for that purpose is probably still illegal in most states, both now, and very likely, forever.   It seems to me that this problem, like all problems, can be solved cheaply, easily, and in questionable quality via outsourcing to China or India.  Perhaps the best options for those with a serious and determined goal of having children is to go to a foreign country where a woman might reasonably value money more than the physical closeness of their offspring.  Pay said woman the average of a year's wage's (roughly 6k in India I think, probably less in rural china) plus medical fees and then go pick up your child, possibly allowing time for breastfeeding.  Have as many as you like, money allowing, and then when you're done: go look for your unicorn.  A unicorn that hopefully isn't terribly attached to the genetic identity of her children.  Or hell, maybe don't bother, just go hire a nanny.   This seems more viable both financially and in terms of finding a woman to suit your needs.  There are of course kinks in this, not the least, being the dietary and physical health of the birth mother during pregnancy, but this could be managed.  In fact, if this practice becomes common spread, perhaps this could lead to the birth of a new industry: free range, organic, kobe womb farms.  I bet there's money to be made.   **Conclusion:**  In terms of pure risk management, separating female commitment and childbearing seems sound.   *PS:* So any takers?  For single fathers here, how is dating/relationships when you have your own kids?  How open are women to raising non related progeny?  Anyone have input on the required finances?
Ex2: Finance is an area in a man's life that shouldn't be about a sage spitting vague advice on top of a mountain, but rather about practical tips based on first hand experience. Unless the guy is trying to sell you some 'get rich quick' method. No one on this forum has this totally figured and there is no universally applicable method.   That being said, I have some money on the side and looking for some non-traditional investment ideas. So What was your best investment in the 0 to 50k€ bracket?  What worked for me in the past:  My best 100€ invested was on website/membership forum I created with a buddy of mine, around something we were passionate about. Returns in the thousands a month at some point. Made me feel cocky enough to leave my job, until we started selling less and I found myself royally fucked, had to sell everything I owned and still ended up homeless and jobless with my career severely hurt. The best part was getting paid to write about something you like. And the huge returns once you ""make it"". Just don't leave your regular job and waste your money.  My best 1000€ investment: was to patent an invention. I am still in the process of producing a prototype so don't have any feedback yet. It could be interesting if it works.  My best 5000€ Investment: Masters degree, hands down.   My best 30000€ investment: Buying a flat is Spain. That's where I would go on vacation anyeay and I rent it to exchange american students for 6 months a year. Somehow risky but Spain's economy is getting better and the only way is up for the future. My advice is to rent to female north-american students, selected through craigslist, instead of local websites. They don't have guarantors thus you can ask for a higher rent but they are generally cleaner, and easier to deal with than boys (fear of being homeless is bigger is my little conjecture). Other places I am considering: Greece: Dirt cheap but higher risk of the country going Mad Max. Bulgaria: Super cheap too. Less risky. On its way to becoming a trendy tourist destination like Croatia.  So let me hear what you have. What's your best Xxx amount of money invested? 
Ex3: ""Man, I'm looking forward to the day my hair grows back to normal!""  If this is you every time after you went to the hairdresser, it is most likely the case that your hairdresser sucks ass. Simple as that. Honestly, I felt the same way every time I got my hair done. But then a thought arised that sounds odd to so many people that I know:   ""Why not invest a little bit more money and find a more expensive hairdresser? Maybe he'll do better work.""  Now, I know what some of you might think when you read the term ""more expensive"". Seriously, throwing away 50 bucks per week to get fucked up at the club? ""Totally fine!"" Buying new clothes on a regular basis that you simply don't need? ""Yeah, why not!?"" Eating a lot of fast food because you're too lazy to cook? ""Ha, sure!""  Investing more than 20 bucks per month to get your hair done? ""FUCK, who do you think I am! Bill MOTHERFUCKING Gates?!""  That's plain childish, but the usual response I receive when I recommend to search for a better hairdresser. The average price for a hairdresser might be around 15€ (around 18$) here. And if you really don't give a shit about your hair at all, you might even get it done with 9€.   Personally, I am investing 25€ (29$) per month in a hairdresser, and it has been one of the best decisions I have ever made. I really don't see why people go batshit crazy when they hear that. People are willing to invest a lot of money in the most useless stuff, but investing like 10€ - 15€ more per month in order to have really nice hair just seems to be completely out of question.   Since I started to go to a better hairdresser, my hair looks sharp throughout the entire time, from the day I go there until the day I go there again. This is simply due to the fact that a hairdresser that gets paid better is capable of taking much more time to get his work done. On the other hand, when you go to one of those fucked up places just to invest as little money as possible, the hairdresser also wants to you to go away as soon as possible because the next 10 customers are already waiting.   Unless you have extremly good hair due to genetics that can't be fucked up anyway, consider going to a more expensive hairdresser and see how it works out. Now, of course you should still try to find a hairdresser with good reviews, plus, make sure that you only pay the money to get your hair done, not some other kind of bullshit like receiving massages or something like that, which is also often included in the programm of ""high-standard-hairdressers"".   TL;DR: Go get a better hairdresser. 
Ex4: The other day a customer was complaining about his wife who spends all his money, regardless on how much he makes. She just spent 150 on scented candles and wanted another 250 for a new vacuum cleaner. She was disappointed when the husband said she'll have to wait until next week. He couldn't understand how could she be so demanding. He makes about double a medium salary, and about 4x a minimum salary. Still, they barely make it to the end of the month.   The guy was out of his mind about this. Why can't we save some of that money? It should make sense to have some money for rainy days, isn't it? But no, she spends it all, and more.  That made me think. There has to be a reason for this behavior.   From what I learned about evolution and red pill theory, there is a reason. She wants your money tied up to her. All surplus has to be spent by her and her children. She can't risk that your extra wealth is used to start a new relationship. Even if all her needs are met and she doesn't really need the scented candles, this way she makes sure it doesn't benefit a potential rival. She risks maybe not having money in a time of need, but that time hasn't come yet and she may find a better option than you when shit hits the fan. And she still may sell the candles, diamonds, jewelry, car and all expensive gifts you bought for her.  The whole economy is based on women spending their husbands' money on useless crap. Ever wondered why? This may be the real reason.  So, working hard to ""earn"" her respect does nothing. It doesn't matter how hard your wheels are spinning, her demands will always be higher than what you can provide. It's up to you to stop her demands and use the money to benefit you. Even if you only use it to save it for rainy days, don't think that she will listen to reason. Control the money, for your sake, and hers. Edit: and, of course, never marry.  Tl;dr: The more you make, the more they spend.

Ex1: Was looking for info on this throughout the sub reddit and couldn't find it. So I compiled my own guide from the advice of a criminal defence lawyer who has defended men falsely accused of rape.  You're always at risk of being fucked over by the feminine imperative, but by employing these simple precautions you can greatly reduce your odds  Before sex:  - on your first encounter, qualify that she doesn't share any SJW sentiments, doesn't have SJW friends and also isn't batshit crazy  - save any messages she sends you that imply she'd wanna fuck you, potentially fishing for them if need be by making the text conversation sexual  During sex:  - get her to put the condom on, making sure her fingerprints are on the condom and the wrapper (will explain why later)  - film it. Yes it's often illegal, but the only situation the police would find out is after you've already been accused, have hypothetically brought it up with your lawyer who has then recommended bringing fourth the recording. It's a no-lose, provided you don't fucking tell anyone you film yourself fucking. would you rather be penalised for filming... or for rape? (There are sneaky apps for filming that make doing it easy and retard-proof) I do not know if audio recordings would be permissible. Yes this is ""a bit much""... But if you've been seriously accused then this is your only real ace-in-the-hole.  After sex:  - take her out for breakfast, even if you don't want to (Mike Tyson said that if he'd just driven the girl home, he wouldn't have done time)  - at least text her saying you enjoyed last night (makes her feel like less of a slut, which discourages ""buyer's remorse"", And it's not something a rapist would do)  In the event of ""buyer's remorse"":  - dont apologise if she says she's upset about what happened, the apology will imply you raped her. Just say you enjoyed the experience and you hope to see her again (something which a rapist wouldn't say)  - if she says she's upset take her out to dinner in a public place and get her smiling etc... And don't ever see her again (something a rapist wouldn't do)  In the event of accusation:  - do not talk to the police. Literally not a fucking word. Don't pick up if they call you. They can just make shit up and they can and will lie to you. (Read some of the stories in the comments if you're not convinced)  - claim you've got the condom and the wrapper with her fingerprints on them, this might panic the bitch enough to drop the allegations  Most of this comes from Cernovich's website, so props to him, if you wanna read more and find out about the laws for recording and shit, check out his post http://www.dangerandplay.com/2011/09/21/how-to-avoid-a-false-rape-case/ and here's his podcast where you hear from the criminal defence lawyer about his case defending against a rape accusation and some of the shit cops will try to pull http://www.dangerandplay.com/2014/06/08/avoid-false-rape-accusation/  I've already started employing many of these practices and feel a lot more peaceful knowing I'm relatively safer. Hopefully you can experience this too.  EDIT: added other suggestions from commenters.
Ex2: I hear lots about how bad it is to be a man today. Fem-liberal agenda destroying men's rights etc etc but actually when has it ever been a better time to be a man than a woman. In every age as far as I can tell men have provided and women have stayed home and looked after children and the home. In every age it has been the men fighting, and dieing and getting crippled. I know, I know....""but what about those poor women who died in chilbirth'. How many were there?  10%, 30% ? How many men got septicaemia from minor wounds. Gee, I can be outside ploughing all day, or I can be inside where it is warm.Any profession before electricity was a tough one. Pick a time in history where men weren't dieing in their thousands. Pick a nation. I can't.    Again I hear the feminists cry, ""but women were raped and rape is bad."" No-one disputes rape was and is bad. Is it as bad as being dead? No. Is it as bad as being crippled or having 4ft of spear stuck through you? No again IMVHO. I know Hillary Clinton wants us to believe women are the real victims of war. Bullshit, women are the survivors of war, and every brother or husband they lose is probably also some mans brother or son or father. Look at the perks of being alive today. Vasectomies are quick and easy. There are lots of tools to reduce the effects of a lifetime of labour on our bodies. There is more contraceptive available and screening for a range of genetic defects so our children have more chance of being born healthy. The actual number of hours most men work is less now than at almost any other time in history, excluding depressions.   Yeah, our rights are getting eroded but the state is also stepping in. No longer do you have to get married to a girl just because you got her knocked  up.  tl,dr? It could be worse.       I am not a troll. I just think that instead of sitting around crying because feminists have all the power, either become a MRA or actually get on with life. Feminists are not that scarey. My fwb says she is a feminist. She still loves sucking my cock and being spanked. My other plate claims to be a feminist but she knows I am not monogamous and is still dtf. If you know your facts and show your willingness to disagree. You get far more respect than by agreeing with feminists.     For all those guys bleating about they can't do anything in case they face a rape charge orsexual harassment charge. Have you not learned anything about SMV. If she is begging you to fuck her it is not rape or sexual harassment.   Women still like a confident, sexually aware man. Women still like fit and healthy men. Women still like sex. Medicine has gotten to the point that most std's are treatable, no more dying of tertiary syphillus. We also have power tools, drag racing, mma, and so much more. I think it is a great time to be a man. So sue me.
Ex3: One of the many articles on this case: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-judge-who-asked-an-alleged-rape-victim-why-she-couldnt-keep-her-knees-together-might-lose-his-a7235601.html  tl;dr a judge in a rape case asked a the alleged victim why she couldn't keep her legs closed. Rather than assume the judge was trying, maybe in a brusque way, to figure out the fact of the case, pretty much the entire world assumes he's a misogynist rape apologist who thinks women get raped because they try to close their legs.  There's not much more to say really. At this point, the rape hysteria is so out of control law enforcement, judges and private citizens have enormous incentives to throw accused men under the bus rather than try to figure out the truth, because when they do not immediately and completely believe the accuser (which includes not asking too many questions) they're hit with all the power of extra-legal political and social shaming.  All of this, of course, constitutes a portion of the system constructed to keep men fearful and subservient to the Feminine Imperative: in all dealings with women men must be made to be fearful and submissive, so as to extract maximum resources from them.
Ex4: New essay at The Rational Male:  https://therationalmale.com/2017/12/18/dangerous-times-part-1/  Excerpt:  **Articles of Belief**  Shortly after I wrote Yes Means Fear I wrote Hysteria, an essay intended to address the disgraceful (now thoroughly proven) UVA fraternity rape hoax story written by Sabrina Erdley and published by a complicit Rolling Stone Magazine. Just daring to question the validity of so outrageous a rape account was heresy to women back then. Bear in mind this took place after the Yes Means Yes consent ruling in California. At this time, just to question the story of a woman’s rape account was enough to earn you the title of ‘rape apologist’. But moreover, we were popularly expected to repeat this mantra and always accept a woman’s account as infallibly true:  &gt;&gt;“No matter what Jackie said, we should automatically believe rape claims.” http://t.co/3HFlXR7jme True insanity pic.twitter.com/AFXIyn32FS  This was the sentiment (now deleted) tweeted by Zerlina Maxwell on December 6th, 2014. Since then this meme that anything a woman had to say about sexual assault must be believed by default has snowballed into a default belief that anything a woman alleges against a man must also be believed. Whereas a male college student might stand in front of his kangaroo court at a university, now men must stand in front of the kangaroo court of public opinion where a woman’s word outweighs all pretense of due process. That college kid is now the average man who must prove his innocence because if a woman alleges it due process is reversed.  **What we’ve witnessed in just 3 years is the systematic removal of a man’s right to habeas corpus with regard to women’s allegations.**  And I expect that this removal will extend to much more than just women’s believability in regard to sexual misconduct. Imagine a culture where it’s expected that anything a woman accuses her ex of is to be believed in divorce proceedings.  We’re now seeing exactly what myself, Deti, Dalrock and countless other Red Pill bloggers and commenters predicted would happen, but it’s also so much more that what we could see coming. In just 3 years Yes Means Yes moved off the campus and into mainstream culture; a culture predicated on female social primacy. In a feminine-primary social order even “affirmative consent” isn’t enough – “enthusiastic consent” must now be established and maintained. That “enthusiastic consent” is a new ambiguously defined terminology, and part of the larger narrative meant to further confuse and instill fear in men.

------------------------------

Ex1: TL;DR: Got in a car accident, AWALT.  Here's a rant for you, got in a wreck with a woman. Naturally she is lacking in accountability, responsibility, dignity, and self awareness. I'll try and keep it brief.  I was driving down a busy rural highway yesterday. I see an old Chevy Cavalier trying to make a right and join the traffic, so I move to the left lane to make room. The little Chevy pulls out, crosses two lanes and slams into the side of my truck.  I pull to the shoulder and sit in there for a minute to compose myself before engaging the other driver. I've been in this situation a few times and have learned how to handle it.  The other driver gets out, its a woman. Oh shit. I make no comments, just ask for her insurance information. She refuses and responds with ""My car isn't really damaged so we can just go. It was your fault anyway."" (Why are women so fucking self centered?) I respond by silently pulling out my phone and calling the sheriff department.   As I am wading through the bureaucratic cesspool that is American law enforcement, I see two kids get out of the back seat.   So the cops come, they separate us and listen to our stories. As I am telling my side, I see her being detained. Fuck! (in my state, if you don't have insurance they don't let you drive.) She starts screaming, crying, cursing, using every tool in her emotional manipulation toolbox to get out of this situation while the kids witness her breakdown. But one of the cops is a woman and she ain't fallin' for that shit.   So, this woman is driving recklessly, with two kids in the car, without insurance, and an utter lack of self awareness.   Now I have to pay to get my truck fixed, unless I want to sue her, and her kids get to see what an emotional, selfish wreck their mother is.   After giving my statement I drive off with the crazy bitch in my rear view, still making a scene and her kids still watching and the cops still not giving a shit.  Im no parent but there are kids in my family and I adore them. When I drive with them I am the absolute model of the defensive driver. What the fuck is she thinking?! Risk your own life if you like, but what about the children! Cunts like this make me livid.  Lessons learned:  Keep money in your bank account Keep calm in bad situations Keep your insurance up to date Keep away from single mothers in shitty old cars  Be safe out there, brothers.   
Ex2: I joined this place late 2015. The idea of a LTR/marriage was mocked back then, and rightly so. Now we keep seeing posts about ""girlfriends"" instead of ""plates"" and even users advocating for marriage. There is even a flair for LTR. I'm not going to discuss marriage, if you really don't get it by now I don't know what to tell you.   LTRs are like marriage, without the legal aspects. You won't get divorce raped, but you're still a beta. Ask yourself, why would a reasonable man ever commit to a woman? Historically, men did this in order to start a family. They provide for the woman and in return they get children and a woman who submits to them.  The problem today is, the west is not a place to start a family. You can not have children, they belong to the mother. Even if they don't get taken from you, you are not allowed to raise your kids the way you want. You can't spank them, because you risk loosing them and this pussified society will lock you up for ""child abuse"".   So if you do not want kids, why commit to a woman? Give me one good reason...You can fuck her and even date her if you like, without committing. A man who was swallowed the pill seeks plates, he would never restrict himself to a single woman.  Committing, in hopes of a romantic LTR, is what a weak man does. If you are dead set on having a wife and kids, then MOVE.
Ex3: I had the misfortune of seeing yet another CNN special on ""Human Trafficking"" and, once again, the bias and misinformation triggered me.  THIS is the definition of ""slavery"":  &gt;A relationship characterized by coercive control and a loss of freedom of movement such that the person is not able to freely move about and/or is unable to leave their employment.  So according to the SJW lying fucks we have THREE elements of a ""slave"":""  1.  Subject to coercive control  2.  Unable to move about freely  3.  Unable to leave their employment  As soon as I saw the definition flashed on the screen I recognized it immediately as **a TYPICAL divorce for men.**  1.  Coercive control:  Men are subject to the coercive control of an emotional terrorist in the home.  In a divorce the woman will use the children, she will lie about sexual assault, she will withhold the children from the man, she will alienate the man from his friends and even his family.  This is the essence of coercive control!  If her power slips in any way, she can call in the White Knights in Blue with big guns, small dicks, and billy clubs to pummel her husband into submission, chain him up, and throw him in a dark cell where we laugh with great delight about his risk of being a victim of sexual assault.  I have seen MORE THAN ONE woman taunt her husband as he was being taken to jail for non payment of support:  ""Don't bend over to pick up the soap.""  Even the female judge smiled.    2.  Unable to move about freely:  A man with children in divorce is NOT free to move.  He is not free to take his kids to the park.  He is not free to find a better place to live.  A man with children is literally held hostage by the woman.  Eshar Villar talks about children as adorable but that women use them as ""hostages"" and it is 100% true.    Divorced men almost never get custody so if they wish to see their kids they are literally held prisoner in the location where the wife decides they are going to live.  The husband has almost no say whatsoever.  I have seen SEVERAL cases where the man is trying to see the kids and the wife continually thwarts his visitation.  Nothing is done no matter how much money the man spends on motions and lawyers.    Then a couple months later (after the husbands motion to enforce visitation is denied or delayed and deferred) the woman comes in with a motion to change domicile. The man argues that she just wants to move to a different State so she can take the kids away from the father and move in with a thug boyfriend who has a record of child rape.  The man almost always loses no matter what evidence is produced.  The kids go wherever mom decides no matter how bad it is for the dad because THE DAD DOESN'T MATTER.  ONLY THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE ~~CHILDREN~~ WOMAN MATTERS.  * 3.  Unable to leave employment:  I worked at a legal aid clinic for a year and represented men thrown in jail for nonpayment of support almost every day.  These were men who lost jobs or were fired.  They looked for work and could not find it.  None of the reality mattered.  All that mattered was they owed a woman money.  The State enforced this at the point of a gun.    No man is free to leave his employment once his wife files for divorce else he be thrown in jail for nonpayment of support.  Then while in jail, he obviously can't make any money but the amount owed continues to go up.  None of that matters.  The State WILL force you to pay at the point of a gun and under threat of being reduced to chains.  They whine almost every week on CNN about the so called 40 million human ""slaves"" that are victims of ""trafficking.""  Of course this only counts women.  If we count the REAL slaves in the world, the figure is closer to 2 billion.  Don't expect to see any CNN stories on the plight of REAL oppression in the world today.

Ex1: Summary: Flirting with a woman is like trying to hold intelligent conversation with a brick wall.  Topic level: Beginner  ***  T'is I, your evil Zionist overlord here to help you overcome the ineffectual emasculation training that the matriarchy has imprinted.  The idea of a shit test is a relic from the PUA days of TRP. The truth is that it is a terrible way to look at things and completely points you in the wrong direction. Test implies conscious thought on part of the woman with a specific goal in mind. We attribute to her the notion that she is testing us in order to determine alpha validity. My experience is that this is FALSE.  Accepting your own status as a dumbshit is important because you can quickly realize that the bitch you are gaming is a bigger dumbshit than you are. That's right. In my experience, she isn't shit-testing you. She is dumbshit who doesn't actually have anything productive or witty to say and is just spouting nonsense. The shit test is just her lying on her fucking back and expecting you to do all the work conversationally.  Shit test implies both agency and participation on behalf of the woman. Again, my experience is that this is false. She expects you to plan, execute, and pay for every single thing in a relationship while she just goes through the minimum effort half-assed motions. Is it so hard to believe she is exactly the same way conversationally?  So this brings us to the core of what is dumbshit game. It is the beginner level technique I practiced after realizing that people were dumbshits. How well could you carry on a conversation with a non-participating barely-literate dumbshit?  The answer is to pull her into your frame. Which is TRP speak for putting on a verbal puppet show for a bitch. You have your own brand, your own world, your own perspective and she is a passive tourist in it. She will, of course, test your frame. Some people will say that this is her way of accessing your alpha qualities. I disagree. That girl is a dumbshit that has been in dozens and dozens of relationships and failed every single one of them. She isn't testing you. She simply doesn't know how to properly behave within a relationship.  Back to the topic. You need to pull her into your world despite her dumbshit ways. For that, my default tool is the monologue. How well can you fillibuster a glorified blowup doll? (A fillibuster is when an American senator talks for hours to a sleeping congress in order to stall a vote). Few things are as useful as rehearsed sentences related to common topics that come up. You weren't just going out there without a fully drawn out identity, right?  You need to sell yourself and a simple Q&amp;A won't work. If you are thinking smalltalk, that doesn't work. Smalltalk is death. Pleasantries is bad. You need to up those tingles. You need to paint with a vivid brush the autistic masterpiece that is you. That is the core of dumbshit game, by dumbshits for dumbshits to be used on dumbshits.  So your homework is to defend yourself and sell yourself. Why have you become what that you are? Defend those parts of yourself and make it interesting. Be able to talk about  it and convincingly defend your position. Be entertaining and charming and witty. You need to show her that you have the muscles AND the brains. Write it down and practice it.  You will eventually have a large assortment of mini-monologues and a large assortment of little tricks. That takes time, effort, and practice.  These are topics that will come up anyway. Short responses won't work because she expects you to carry the entire conversation. Have that monologue prepared.  That is it for now. Happy Hanukah.  ***  TLDR: Monologues are useful tools in talking to bitches who barely participate except to throw out shit tests.
Ex2: I was browsing through ""Surely you're joking Mr. Feynman!"" and look what I found!   ""We went over to their table and he introduced me to the girls and then went off for a moment. A waitress came around and asked us what we wanted to drink. I ordered some water, and the girl next to me said, ""Is it all right, if I have a champagne?""  ""You can have whatever you want,"" I replied coolly, ""'cause you're payin' for it."" (Not putting her at a pedestal)  ""What's the matter with you?"" She says. ""Cheapskate, or something?"" (Shit test 1)  ""That's right."" (Holding frame)  ""You're certainly not a gentleman!"" she said, indignantly. (Shit test 2)  ""You figured me out immediately!"" I replied. (Agree and amplify)  I had learned in New Mexico many years before not to be a gentleman.    Pretty soon they were offering to buy me drinks - the tables were turned completely! ""  And these were prostitues in Vegas! Holy crap! What a cool scientist!  And of course, the red pill works.
Ex3: Long time lurker first time poster. Not sure If I did the flair right. But this is a FR. ------------------------------------------ Quick background: devoured the sidebar and hoping to contribute something worthwhile, and keep the blah blah in my post to a minimum. So me, in my 30's, STEM field, good finances, athletic, with a 24yr HB7, or 22/30 (on the Patrice O'neil scale) as a LTR prospect. Sorry If format is shit.  I introduce new activities to the bedroom from time to time. Usually the morning after the ""have you done this with another girl already?"" comes out. The last few times a single AA or phrase turning and subject change have handled it. Now it was up a level on her part. The other night, went to my garage and shagged on my motorbike.  (to understand the story i got a bit buzzed with a friend before i saw her). I was smiling and amused during the whole convo.  Girl: so do you do that often on your moto? Me: do what?  Girl: you know what.... Me: -stare then look away-  Girl: was that a first time? Me: Totally, I've never had you on my moto before  Girl: -scoff- have you been with someone else on your moto? Me: Oh yeah. it's great. you go faster downhills with someone on the back.  Girl: -head roll- have you had sex with another girl on your moto? Me: Oh yeah. But I was kinda high last night so now recalling whether it was my fantasy vs reality....it's all cloudy right now.  Girl: It's really difficult to get something concrete from you Me: I do agree that vanilla icecream is superior to chocolate  end of questioning.  During the day other shit tests that came unprovoked (and easily defeated) were: ""you know you're short for a guy"", ""you're not getting any younger"".  5 min after I passed those she tugs me out of public view for a makeout sesh.   I'm thinking if there is a next time and she goes up a level or even to nuclear or withhold sex. I figure a sprinkle of dreadgame should work well if it goes there, as if to say to her ""obviously I've done a lot before, that's why you're satisfied, but if you fuck with me I can obviously go off to where I was doing that before"". -------------------------------------------------------  *Shit tests never stop even when you are makin' them swoon.  *Shit tests can be fun  Obligatory thank you to TRP for improving my life.  Edit: tried to use line segment dividers as per rules, but it just made the font bigger. shit.
Ex4: FYI: I was originally gonna post this on a pick up sub but I think it really belongs here.   I've never had a shortage of interest from women, in fact all my friends (including the female ones) have always been shocked at how much attention I get. I've never really had the desire to hook up with tonnes of random girls, and have always preferred relationships, so I've rejected a bunch of girls in my life. Also I'm Indian so to the Indian guys out there who say they can't get laid, you're either in a pretty racist place (which does sometimes happen to be fair) or you're not happy with your life currently so aren't giving off positive vibes- I've had times where I haven't been happy and trust me the female attention I got was way less, but this was not to do with race.   One thing I've learnt from interacting with all these women is this- If a woman shit tests you constantly and makes things difficult, she is not worth YOUR time. If you're just looking for a one night stand then this is different, you can put in the effort to pass these tests and get laid, but if it's a relationship you're after and the girl you want is shit testing you constantly I would say move on. All women will shit test to some degree, but in my experience confident high value (better personality and looks) women who know they want a strong guy actually test less, are more choosy and better judges of character. So if they meet an alpha male, they can already pick up on his vibe and know he is strong. That's not to say they don't shit test at all, they definitely do, but not to the same level of these other low value, often mentally ill women. I have generally found the higher value women to be more fun and less bitchy.   Honestly I would say that if you are in contact with a girl and she is really making it that difficult for you then you should just find someone else. Even if you think the girl really likes you but is hiding it, this is not the kind of girl you should want to be with because she will make your life miserable. Also, chances are that if she really likes you but is testing you this heavily it's because she has been fucked over a lot in the past and is now damaged as a result. She'll also be more likely to cheat. Steer clear.   A lot of pick up guys will always talk about passing shit tests, and this is right for the initial approach and if you wanna get laid, but if she is still testing thq fuck out of you well into your relationship then either you're being a little bitch or she is mentally ill (probably the latter tbh).   Anyway that's just my two cents, I think it's advice worth taking.

Ex1: [**Full article here**](http://roguehealthandfitness.com/principles-of-rogue-health/), I recommend checking it out. I bought this guy's book ""Muscle Up"" the other day, he's great and so is his site - [**I discovered him through Twitter.**](https://twitter.com/Mangan150) He definitely sets himself apart from all the other fitness guys out there because he's not on that bro science bullshit, but actually reads a lot of studies and is very studious in his intellectual rigour. Got a lot of respect for this guy, definitely recommend you check out this article and then the wider blog as a whole. His supplement buying guide is also pretty awesome.  **Taken from the linked article:**  1. Maintenance of a lean body mass with a relatively low level of body fat is important both for health and for slowing aging. Fat tissue is not neutral, but produces inflammatory cytokines that lead to overall, generalized inflammation, which is bad.  2. While having too much fat is bad, having too little muscle may be worse. This can be seen in the fact that waist circumference is a much more accurate indicator of health than body mass index. Muscle is a highly metabolically active tissue, and contributes to glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity.  3. We all lose muscle as we age, and most people do nothing about it. Lost muscle, if taken far enough, leads to sarcopenia, frailty, and loss of independent living in old age. Increase and maintenance of muscle mass is one of the most important health interventions around.  4. Insulin sensitivity is important for health and aging. A decrease in insulin sensitivity (an increase in insulin resistance) is often seen in aging, and is the main feature of type 2 diabetes. But it doesn’t have to be this way, and attention to diet and exercise can maintain youthful levels of insulin sensitivity.  5. Weightlifting, also known as strength training and resistance training, is the best form of exercise for staying lean, maintaining and growing muscle, combating the frailty of aging, and maintaining good insulin sensitivity.  6. High intensity training (HIT), is a very effective form of exercise and can be used as an adjunct or, for some, a replacement to weightlifting.  7. Aerobic exercise, that is exercises such as running, walking, or the use of cardio machines in the gym, have health benefits, but as such they come in a distant second to weightlifting and HIT. They are very ineffective for fat loss, mainly because they don’t build muscle and may in fact accelerate its loss. Distance running can actually be harmful, leading to joint injuries that sometimes necessitate surgery, and heart problems.  8. You can’t outrun a bad diet. Weightlifting and HIT are the only exercises that have been shown to have a material effect on fat loss, but even here, if fat loss is the goal, attention must be paid to diet. It’s extremely easy to eat more than enough calories than you exercise away. “Burning” calories through exercise is close to nonsensical. Hunger always wins.  9. If hunger always wins, then to lose fat one must choose a way of eating that dampens hunger. Low-carbohydrate diets, especially those that forbid sugar and refined carbohydrates like flour, are the best for controlling hunger.  10. The cholesterol hypothesis of heart disease is nonsense. Statins have tiny effects on mortality with the potential of large, deleterious side effects.  The other 10 principles can be found here: **http://roguehealthandfitness.com/principles-of-rogue-health/**
Ex2: **Women are a Lagging Indicator**  So here’s the deal.  Life is about The Journey.  You can go read about the “Hero’s Journey” in Joseph Campbell’s work, or in Michael Moorcock’s, or even Mark Twain’s, like in “Huckleberry Finn” where on their way to freedom, Huck and Jim are really already free.    This is why TRP tells you to Lift.  So you can be in the best physical condition FOR YOU.  Because being a fat slob is no fun, just ask any fat slob.  It sux, and, secondarily, it keeps you from getting girls, too.  Look, I can tell you I’m a successful guy, which I am, or that I bang 21-22 y.o. women, which I do.  I can share all the knowledge I have, and hope you **LURN** from it.  I’m not running a religion and your faith is NOT required, but if you only believe ONE THING I ever say, believe this: **If you don’t have your health, you don’t have SHIT.**  So Lift, run, do yoga, swim (I recommend this, because when you are old you can still swim), eat clean do whatever the fuck you need to do to be healthy.  Because without it, you’re nothing.    What is the best exercise for you to do?  The one you will do EVERY FUCKING DAY.  Ask Dmitri Young.  He was a ~~professional athlete~~ baseball player.  MoFo weight 291 pounds...and it wasn't a good look.  It was also probably a lie.  I'd say 325.  Either way, that dude was F-A-T, FAT.  He’s 205 now, and **[looks like he should be in a Save the Children](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dc-sports-bog/wp/2014/07/28/dmitri-young-explains-his-amazing-weight-loss/)** commercial.  Srsly, he looks like 50 Cent when he lost all that weight for his role in *Things Fall Apart*.  Google it.  It’s a fucked up look.  So what about lagging indicators?  Women are a lagging indicator of success.  WHEN you are in shape, WHEN you are successful, WHEN you have made yourself excellent in one or more ways, THEN the pussy will flow.  You think I would be sliding my 49 y.o. cock in to 21 y.o. pussy if I was a fat slob with no game and nothing going on?  Not.Gonna.Happen.  Sure I look like I’m made up out of [spare dinosaur parts](http://www.bytez.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dino.jpg), but I built my life, I put in my time in the House of Iron, I became Excellent At Something (a couple of somethings) AND I have game.  That’s why you never see me here whining about being a no-pussy-getting-MFer.  Instead I’m dealing out solid advice to the young men.  That shit doesn’t just *HAPPEN*.  S’allz I’m sayin’.  Don't worry about women.  Be the Best Version of You that You Can Be.  If You Build It, They Will Come.  And they will keep coming.   
Ex3: This post is written for the purpose of defining the halo effect and my experience and observations.    ITS a real thing that people either consciesly or un-con·scious·ly project towards those with high SMV  So what is **The Halo Effect**   According to Google:   **The halo effect is a cognitive bias in which an observer's overall impression of a person, company, brand, or product influences the observer's feelings and thoughts about that entity's character or properties.**   **My experience**:Now that im looking my best im able to see things for what they really are. We live a politically  correct society but mostly everyone behaves or acts in the opposite way.people get easily offended by little  things.Forget about being right or logical or just being a good person in general(dont harm anyone tho)people only listen or do things that benefits them in some way.I seriously notice how people treat me when im well dressed vs when im not well dressed.And i have done my own little social experiment on the halo Effect and 20 times out of 10 i always come to the same conclusion.PEOPLE DONT CARE IF YOU ARE A GOOD PERSON OR NOT.To them a good looking,well dressed person is a good person and a fat guy with a great personality and good heart is only a Fat guy UNLESS ,he is famous or rich but then again his status is doing the halo Effect on him.Looks and status is what rules in 2017 dont let anyone try to convince you otherwise, if you think a great personality alone will get you the things you want in life  go ahead but its going to be really HARD as you will need society's approval some how.a 5'5 balding guy could definitely date hot women because ive seen it with my own eyes and we all have, but thats because either his game is top notch or he has good things going on for him(natural Alpha).   **Why it matters so much**:The halo Effect is basically society's aproval in a nutshell.when a women gives you the look like she  wants to fuck you without you saying a word is because you are a good looking dude or maybe she just feels slutty and wants attention,but almost everytime you get the alpha pass through either looks or status,with personality  or game you will have to prove it to them first.    **to wrap it up**:Take advantage of the halo effect to get  ahead in Shallow America,whether you have goals in  business or whatever the fuck you want to do  you are selling yourself as the product  so build a good marketing behind it  and of course match it with a good personality(i never said it dint matter)but remeber to most cats out there your outside presence will dictate the rest of the inside    Sorry for my formatting and sorry for my formatting again!!! 
Ex4:  It’s Saturday night, we’re celebrating a friends birthday party, I’m with my boys, older brother and his friends having a great time by the bar, holding court and trading war stories.   Then:  “ Fuck!! these fat bitches! The nerve! Why is she looking at me.“...    “ Is she really trying to get with me? who does she think I am?”   Proclaimed one of my brothers friends, A red pill man by many standards, 28YO in shape, working in finance with a six figure salary and a small real estate portfolio on the side.   As we looked over to the source of his contempt, we observed a scene primarily reserved for the National Geographic. A herd of what couldn’t only be described as post wall or on the verge of it, very slutty dressed hippopotamuses.  After a few minutes of furious laughter at his frustration and her attempts to open my friend. it settled in on me. This expression, as comedic as it was, actually had a lot of symbolism to it - other than the fact that fat women are not attracted to fat men - ironically   If as a human being, I cannot even do the bare minimum to take care of my body, why should anyone be attracted to me ? what have I done to attract that beautiful girl who works out everyday and plans her meals ?   See, he was frustrated because he has worked hard to improve himself, to shape himself into the masculine man and being approached by a woman who could not even control what she put into her mouth, thinking that she was worthy of him, was taken as an insult.   As women are insulted by the advances of beta males, so are men ( * who know what they deserve ) by fat women   Society has taught us to “ accept people as they are” and to be “ just be yourself “. This as I have come to learn from this community, is self destructive at best.   Lesson: Work hard and know what you deserve, and if anyone offers you less, don’t be afraid to tell them to fuck off

Ex1: **Introduction**  University research tries to reconcile the inconsistency between how:    1. Attractive women are *more likely to be promoted* because people tend to project positive traits onto them.   1. Attractive women are *less likely to be hired* if they include a photo in their resume. Attractive men, however, were more likely to be hired.  Then, the researchers discover there is a difference between the post-wall fatties who hire over at [Human Resources](http://i3.cdnds.net/13/30/618x647/obese-woman-sitting-at-office-desk-_preview.jpg) and the boss who promotes people.   **Body**  https://archive.is/O0n4J  Academia can be quite dominated with paradigms of patriarchal control, and so it can be difficult for them to see when women have societal agency.  A group of Israeli academics were trying to reconcile the seeming inconsistency between the bias favoring attractive people, but they were concerned how this bias was unbalanced during the hiring process if a photo was attached to the resume.  Attractive males were favored.  Attractive females were discriminated against.   &gt;For men, the results were as expected. Hunks were more likely to be called for an interview if they included a photo. Ugly men were better off not including one. However, for women this was reversed. Attractive females were less likely to be offered an interview if they included a mugshot. When applying directly to a company (rather than through an agency) an attractive woman would need to send out 11 CVs on average before getting an interview; an equally qualified plain one just seven.  Of course, they were quick to look at all the ways women were objects and victims.  They examined the “dumb-blonde hypothesis”—that people assume beautiful women to be stupid.  Nope.  Not that one.    Well, who is doing the hiring?  Human Resources. Gosh, wouldn't you know it, they're nearly all post-wall jealous women.  After a bunch of research, they were forced to conclude the following.   &gt; So the cause of the discrimination must lie elsewhere. Human resources departments tend to be staffed mostly by women. Indeed, in the Israeli study, **93%** of those tasked with selecting whom to invite for an interview were **female**. The researchers' unavoidable—and unpalatable—conclusion is that **old-fashioned jealousy led the women to discriminate against pretty candidates**.  **Lessons Learned**  Society struggles with giving agency to women.  Men? Lift, groom yourself, and be more attractive. Let that improve your chances of being hired over your tubby competitors.  The ladies in HR will push your application in the right pile. 
Ex2: The dating market is extremely competitive these days, and that's for a myriad of reasons.   Unfortunately, a few genetic defects can completely eliminate you from the dating pool, and these defects are hard to surmount. If you are in this group and you want to present yourself as an attractive individual, you must be punctual, you must be organized, you must have clearly outlined goals and you must be efficient.   Too often, guys who fall into the ""not sexually attractive"" group are circuitously pursuing their goal of being attractive. Let me give you an example of what I am talking about. Let's take a look at the short power lifter, who is deluded into thinking that power-lifting is going to make him attractive. This individual is hard working, consistent, disciplined and dedicated. However, he is not cognizant of what women find attractive. Women are definitely attracted to muscles but they are attracted to lean muscles. The short powerlifter is working very hard in the gym and pushing his body to the limit. He is sore all the time and his joints ache. He is truly putting in a good effort, but complains that women don't find him attractive. In this case, the reason that women don't find him attractive is that the powerlifter is muscular but carries a lot of fat. He spends too much time in the gym and not as much time socializing. His style isn't the best.   If this power-lifter truly enjoys the sport then that is fine, but if he is partially power-lifting to attract more women he should change his approach. This individual's efforts would be better appreciated by the opposite sex if he lost weight, focused on bodybuilding instead of power-lifting and went to socialize more.  Another concept to discuss is the idea of ""monk mode."" Monk mode in and of itself is a good conception. However, the entire idea of isolating yourself from society while you improve on yourself in the hopes of attracting women is contradictory.   A fact that a lot of redpillers fail to acknowledge is that women are attracted to socially adept guys. Being socially adept or popular is important to many women. The persona of a hard working disciplined guy *who does not socialize* is a turnoff to women. Remember that women think with their emotions. They want to be entertained. Hence, a guy who is so uptight and rigid is a turnoff to women because they won't be entertained by him. The exception to this rule is the group of guys who are so physically attractive that the women are already entertained by their appearance. But remember that these guys are not usually the guys who would consider monk mode anyway. So for those of you who are contemplating going into monk mode, you should accept that you need to improve yourself physically and mentally, but at the same time you should also consider improving your social abilities. These two endeavors are not mutually exclusive, and you can accomplish them together. Furthermore, more often than not, those who gravitate towards monk mode need to work on their social skills as well.   Time is an ephemeral commodity and you need to use it efficiently. For those of you who are struggling in the dating market, a good rule to follow is that women are attracted to tall, facially good looking, muscularly defined, well dressed, socially successful and financially stable individuals.   If your goal is to have more sexual opportunities with women, you should focus on improving the aforementioned traits. 
Ex3: So, this is my last real thought on my mind before I spend summer lifting, working, and focusing on ""being happy with myself"". Both are based of happenings in Highschool, which is the only place i get experience doing shut.  Rant: I consider myself at least a 6. I'm not muscular or built (yet), but my face is attractive, I'm funny as hell, and I'm not fat. This is the last goddamn school year I get denied by 3's, 4's, and 5's. I used to always think, ""if you can't get 8's, 9's, and 10's, settle for people less than yourself"". The logic being: they'll see that, in terms of attractiveness, I'm better than they are. Well, 2 years later and I was completely wrong. I read that one TRP post about less-attractive girls not needing to settle for guys who are their level or lower because there will always be 10's who they can chase. It's completely right. I've tried running game on some of the ugliest girls possible. Girls who have wack faces, no body, no figure, no personality. AND i'm still fucking denied. I look around them, and the other guys chasing them are 20x less attractive than I am, some more attractive than me (but very few), and they're getting denied too. I'd think ugly girl = easy game. Well, not true at all. So, First, I'm going to work on my body and my personality this summer, because I will not be denied again by girls who are less than I am on the 1 to 10 scale.  I will destroy these people. I will become so successful that I could buy their shitty lives twenty times over. I will have the money to buy them, their family, and their children. Then, even when we're both dead and gone, my wealth will still be enough to buy the generations that follow them. This, I goddamn swear.

Ex1: Summary: An awesome class that explains popularity, how it's influenced, and how it affects you  I was browsing Coursera, an online academy that offers classes in various subjects, and I found this gem.  https://www.coursera.org/learn/popularity   This course explains the psychology behind what makes us popular, and how popularity affects us all. It also differentiates between two types of popularity: status (social reputation) and likability (social preference). A few TRP truths are also confirmed, such as why being aggressive with women works (it increases status), and why we should lift (a fit body is correlated with higher status and likability).  Definitely worth checking out; backs up a lot of TRP theory with scientific studies. You might even learn a bit too.  As far as the course goes, weeks 1-4 are the most important. You can go through the course at any pace/order.  A few lessons learned:   - Lift; it improves your social reputation  - Being aggressive increases your status at cost of likability - Social skills do matter  Also, this is my first time post, so any feedback would be appreciated.
Ex2: Now I am a 26, and until I have recently read post about social media being a bad thing in TRP community, I have never seen it as that. I had recently been to a RSD seminar and tyler spoke about how he thinks it can be a very useful tool if used right. I agree and have had seen proof of this over the years.  My life is awesome, so my facebook shows that, I have pictures/videos of me having fun, doing cool shit, posting funny videos. I have had multiple woman (including currently my best plate) approach me via facebook. I would have never known this girl would have existed without facebook. I have also had multiple more woman compliment me on my looks, try to start a bullshit convo to get my attention, etc, and then end in a meet up. Now I never ""like"" any girls shit to give them the validation they are seeking. I just use it as a means to connect, all the while it portrays my high SMV. It also gives woman I havent seen in a while a chance to remember me and what they have been missing.   Snapchat, while at the RSD seminar tyler recently discovered snapchat and thought it was the best thing ever, he said this is a way to show a glimpse of how awesome your life is without having to really do any work. I must agree, all day I am doing cool shit, I will post stuff here and there. because of this woman hit me up on it, asking to take them on hikes, and do other fun shit I am involved in. Not to mention It shows the hot woman I hang around. I can meet a girl out at club, exchange snapchats and not have to do barely any work on her for her to see, wow this dude is awesome/funny/exciting. Alot of them dont leave me alone, I can pick and choose, and dont really have to do any work besides live. I am also showing relativity to multiple woman at once. I have had exes or woman who I have exchanged numbers with in the past add me on there. Havent talked to them in years, and they want to reconnect.   Maybe I am missing something but I think social media has played a huge role in my success with woman, it has been the stepping stone for a lot of quality lays for me too.   EDIT: I am willing to delete my facebook and all if you guys can give me a good perspective on why that would be more beneficial than what it has done for me thus far. Maybe there is something I am missing here. 
Ex3: I would not yet call myself a Redpill man, although I am presently on a mission to do so. What I have learnt from my experiences is the first step to becoming Redpill is realising that yourself in your current Bluepill state must deprogramme a large portion of what your perception of the world around you is. Until this is done you will likely not be able to fully grasp and put into practice a large portion of the philosophy that the Redpill teaches. Stop letting things waste your time e.g Facebook, Instagram, etc, this does not mean exclusively social media simply anything that is wasting your time, remove it. All of these things are holding you back from doing productive things and becoming the best version of yourself you could ever be. Being the best version of yourself can be any form you decide it to be just be the strongest you can be, be the most intelligent you can be, and be the happiest you can be. The mission to become the best he can be is the only thing worth a man’s time. The closer you are to being who you want to be, the more confident you will be with who you are and the pussy will follow. Until then my brothers we must be men of focus, commitment, and sheer fucking will.
Ex4: This post will offend many.  The feminine imperative is intricately interwoven into a vast majority of social conventions in today's society.  Many of these are discussed in Rollos works, and the basic premise is that the feminine will leverage these social conventions to their benefit to force compliance, whether through shame, blackmailing, or use of the law.  Socially accepted acculturations will always outweigh sound logic and reason when everyone it speaks to is erratically driven by emotion.  'Family first' is THE most powerful feminine social convention that exists, and many redpill men fail to accept this.  One may be game-aware and be efficient in navigating and discrediting the fallacy of other feminized social conventions, but many will tuck their cocks inbetween their legs and tickle their own buttholes (if well endowed)  when it comes to questioning the family unit.  Nearly every other feminized social convention can bottleneck and be traced to the endgame of family.  This is the trump card when all other efforts to control and manipulate a man have failed. Think of the chiillllldrennnn.  Many-o-men burned by divorce or seen others get zeroed out by it will be the first to jump and say that the family courts are the devil-incarnate when it comes to the Feminine Imperative, and they'd be right!  Yet, some of those very men will still praise the importance of putting family first, whether they got burned by the system or not.  This is an ego investment/preservation strategy a man will use to still hamster to himself that his Blue Pill values of family actually add value to his masculinity.  This is bullshit.  That very thing you believe is so important will be the first thing to plow your asshole like an Iowa field while sprinkling your values out in the process in the form of discount fertilizer for the next dumbasses to feed on, grow, and make the same mistake as you.  You should only use your family for your benefit until you can cut yourself off from them and live by your own values, and do things of your own volition without deferring to the family unit as some sort of religion.  If you need to rely on family (money, rent, etc) once you've matured and made a life for yourself, you are codependent and not at your best as a man.  Machiavellianism isn't prohibited from use on family.  This ain't caveman times.  You don't need to slave your life away for your genetic lineage to survive when humans are at the top of the food chain.  If you really cared about such lineage, you would literally impregnate every woman you possibly could rather than wallowing around in a marriage or LTR and being a 'good man' attempting to raise your kid (s) by your values, which if it's redpill, will be met with opposition from every corner of 'The Village.'  Men are polygamous.  That is your sexual strategy to ensure genetic continuity, not sacrificing everything for one fuck-badge.  At this point, you don't value your genetic lineage and it's survival, you value the feminine imperative and it's cultural brainwashing strategy on how it wants you to raise children in a world of feminine primary, capitalism, and hatred of masculinity.  'Family first' is a Blue Pill value, like it or not.
Ex5: In late July, USC kicker Matt Boermeester was not permitted to return to USC after a Title IX investigation. He was accused of abusing his girlfriend.   What's interesting is that his girlfriend didn't report him. No, an anonymous ""third party"" did. For those who know women, it was likely a jealous woman who was spurned by the football player and wanted revenge on him after she saw him roughly fucking his girlfriend.   Furthermore, his girlfriend, Zoe Katz, fervently defends and stands by her boyfriend. She went so far as to reveal the true colors of the administrators and Title IX investigators to the media and described how she was harassed by the investigator to flip on her boyfriend, how they pegged her as a ""battered woman"" with Stockholm syndrome, thereby flipping her defense of her boyfriend through dime-store psychology, and then was *told* that she should be afraid of her boyfriend.  Nevertheless, this didn't stop her from reporting to various media outlets that it's all bullshit. She respects her boyfriend, because he's a high value male who probably dicks her good.  This is a sign that the Ivory Tower Conspiracy is falling. All injustice is eventually destroyed.   I have personally seen what accusations in college can do to men. I knew a few guys who ran away, a few who barely escaped unjust persecution but were severely psychologically damaged, and some who got kicked out. The ones who were successful were those who fought back. For those with the resources, they went public and weren't afraid to defend themselves in the middle of the Colosseum, in full view of spectators.   When men fight, others gain confidence. Eventually, if the right men, and enough of them, stand for something, the women who matter stand with them.  When it comes to social issues, that's the sign that you're winning. When women join your side.   In war, we need only to rip our enemies to pieces, but the social sphere is one designed by women and who they align with signifies a significant advantage.   Want more proof? It's because of the support of women that feminism even took hold in the first place. Cuckolds saw that women were protesting and hollering for equal rights and lefts, and they decided to give them the former. Why? Because they have no other mating strategy than to yield to the laments of women.   Once there's no longer a surplus of high-profile women yammering for the mass arrest of straight white-males or the end of rape culture, even the cucks will have to stop yelling, because they will no longer get the one thing  they ever truly won from the cuckery - momentary attention from the women they orbit.   The only reason they had any success is because the percentage of Alphas in the halls of learning shrunk, for whatever reason. The strong intellectuals of yesteryear were replaced by wimpy pseudo-intellectuals who could quote Derrida in coffee shop conversations. This led to a tradition of pseudo-intellectuals who would virtue signal to their pseudo-intellectual thesis advisers, creating a staff and administration of cucks with impressive sounding degrees.   But without the support of women, their public power will diminish. No one will care about them anymore.  Which means their funding will die.  Schools will either adapt or die.   So for most cucks, they will no longer have a job.   No pussy. No money. No social status.   They will be what they always were - cucks.   Then, they will either have to jump into the Arena with us and improve as men, or they'll die via self-obliteration (or at least as canon fodder in the upcoming wars - at least they'd serve a purpose then).    We're winning, boys.   Attractive, high status women (Katz is cute, and a D1 level tennis player) are now standing up for men in the social arena, but only because we were willing to stand for ourselves.   Press on. We will win, and then we will fuck their women.

Ex1: This rule has been also called The Brad Pitt rule on the art of manliness website.  Here is the gist of the rule.  If you ask a girl out and she says no without giving you an option to re-schedule, move on because she is not interested.   If she says no and then suggests another time that means she still has interest and you need to come up with a new time that works for the both of you.  Think of it this way, Imagine that instead of you, David Beckham had asked this same girl out on a date, would she use an excuse with him? If Beckham asked her on a date, would she still say she was busy? Probably not. She would have dropped everything and accepted the date.   Now we know none of us is David Beckham obviously, but if a woman is truly interested in you, she will find the time to go out with you.  I've used this rule before with a lot of success in my journeys. It has saved me time from pursuing girls who are not interested. Add this to your toolbox next time you ask a girl out.   Remember: She has to re-schedule 
Ex2: My last post on TRP received a lot of love, so hopefully you guys picked up some perspective. I like to keep things direct, short, and to the point.  So. Here.  First point:  I was trying to open a potential plate, about a 6, a couple of months ago. Wasn't working out. She finally tells me that she has a ""nine date rule"" before she sleeps with a guy. I reply ""k"", and next her. No contact.  This past weekend, she sends me a message inviting me over. I teased her, asking her what happened to her nine date rule. She replies ""well, I know you're not going to try that hard, so"".  Second point:  There's this guy who exists in the same social circles I do. We'll call him ""Matt"". He's awkward. The definition of ""beta"", even though I cringe to use that word. He was friends with my ex-girlfriend, would flirt with her, tell her how horrible I was. He put that girl on a pedestal so high, it was seriously crazy. Would still listen to her cry, bring her presents, flowers, write her songs, even though he knew what she and I were doing.  Come to find out that this new girl I'm seeing (same one from my last post) has had experiences with ""Matt"" too, used to work with him. He asked her out multiple times, finally she agreed. He got all dressed up, brought her flowers and played her a song he wrote for her on his ukulele. I know. I can't make this up. Needless to say, she was speechless and the date didn't pan out the way Matt had hoped. The evil part of me can't wait until he finds out that I've been involved with both women.   In summary:   Don't make your life about women. Make your life about you and your passions, and the women will come.   Don't be afraid to next. Dear God. Just do it. She'll probably never come back, but when they do, it's just that much sweeter.  Don't be a cringey, needy, strange man. Because I will have this weird mixture of feelings towards you that will generally include feeling sorry for you and wanting to hit you.  Don't be a fucking dweeb.  -BlackWildBoar  
Ex3: On November 2, 2017, the California Supreme Court approved new state bar ethics rules which impose heightened duties on prosecutors in criminal cases.  Why is this important? Men are often the target of overzealous or unethical prosecutions, particularly at the hands of jealous or vindictive women. Prosecutors who bring fake cases can be sanctioned or disbarred under the new rules for not paying attention to exculpatory evidence.  While you might think these are common sense rules, they were not ethically codified until this month.   Among the changes, Rule 5-110 government prosecutors are now ethically required to:  not institute or initiate charges without probable cause; make sure the accused understands his rights to counsel and does not waive important pre-trial rights without full disclosure; disclose all exculpatory evidence that should be obtained through reasonable investigation; properly supervise agents and law enforcement personnel to make objective and unbiased investigations; and obtain reversal of convictions for innocent men when new evidence comes to light that demonstrates the innocence of the accused.  It is estimated that men comprise between 70-80% of arrests, criminal prosecutions and incarceration.  When men are convicted, they are often giving longer sentences than women for the same crimes.  Particularly disturbing is the high rate of male prosecution and incarceration for alleged interpersonal and “domestic violence” cases; even when women commit the same alleged crime at equal or higher rates.  Most states like California now have special domestic violence and sexual assault prosecution task forces. These task forces are created through special interest funding to prosecute and incarcerate men under the false premise that all men are predators and abusers.  Because of these misguided beliefs, prosecutors often intentionally or recklessly ignore evidence that tends to prove the innocence of the accused man or at least mitigates his involvement or culpability. This evidence could include digital evidence, text messages, emails, the history of the relationship, witness and character testimony, mental health issues and other forms of important evidence which might negate the crime or mitigate the sentence or charge for the defendant.  Under the new rules, the prosecutor must pay attention to this evidence, obtain it, and disclose it in the case.  If you are a victim of a fake DV or sexual assault case and believe the prosecutor is behaving unethically, ignoring evidence, and prosecuting your case without probable cause, you should make an official complaint to the California State Bar or your local jurisdiction’s bar licensing agency.   http://www.calbar.ca.gov/Public/Complaints-Claims/How-to-File-A-Complaint.  Failure to abide by these rules can get a prosecutor sanctioned or disbarred.  this article first appeared at http://menslaws.com/  note: while you might think these are common sense rules that should have always been on the books, they were not.  Prosecutors in California and other states enjoy absolute immunity and qualified immunity privileges which they use to cover up their bad behavior.  The new ethics rules override any immunities and privileges that a prosecutor can raise in the civil context.   
Ex4: **Summary:** We should create a list of the key literature that drives our opponents.   ---  **Body:** ""Know thy Enemy""   Feminism is based in Marxism.  Its proponents often use the techniques presented in Saul Alinsky's ""Rules for Radicals"".  It is imperative when facing our opponents that we know both their goals and their techniques.  In this spirit, I submit that we should create a list of the key ideological literature that our opponents use.    ---  **Conclusion:**  Let's start the list with ""The Communist Manifesto"" and ""Rules for Radicals"".  **Edit:**  Here is the list so far:  The Communist Manifesto, Rules for Radicals, Das Kapital, The Mass Psychology of Fascism, Ventotene Manifesto
Ex5: For some reason, there's a contingency of insufferable, condescending cunts who decide to come here and babble about ""hierarchies"" and other JP related horseshit.  They come here and spew either word salad or pretentious diatribes about how we could finally understand how right they naturally are if we just opened up to longer sentences that say nothing. The key markers are as follows:  * Focus on incoherent vocabulary rather than a cogent thesis. * The more nebulous, abstract or ethereal the idea the better.  * Does not in any way address TRP theories, even the ones it seeks to contradict. * Usually goes on and on about the abstractly discrete hierarchies and their rules.  I have absolutely no idea how these people manage to spit out so many words that say nothing. But the condescension and total meaninglessness of their drivel is the reason I'm banning it altogether.  If your idea has merit, you can present it **with respect**, and **without condescension**. Further, you can do so without including a detailed video of you literally sucking JP's dick while doing so.  We will remain a forum about sexual selection and we will continue to treat it as a free market of ideas. **But this troll does not have a home here.**  If you break this rule. Instaban. No Warnings.

Ex1: [Today's exhibit is female solipsisms - which is ""the view or theory that the self is all that can be known to exist.](http://archive.is/GFZOX)  We have a poster who's brother is getting into masculine, self improvement stuff.   &gt;My brother came home from school a week before Christmas and stayed for a bit over two weeks. He goes to school in a different state, and he's in a fraternity. When I picked him up from the airport, I was asking him all about what was going on with him. He mentioned that he started doing self improvement stuff, and I asked, ""oh, what self improvement stuff?"" ""masculine stuff"" ""don't tell me it's the red pill.."" ""wow, I'm surprised you know about it.""  This is a brother who she knows ""he also has low self esteem, and bad luck with girls.""  But before she ever gets there, she spends the entire post talking about ""me, me, me"" and ""I, I, I"" and ""feelings, feelings, feelings.""   This dumb broad, recognizing the issues that her brother is facing, doesn't spend a single moment thinking about how she could possibly help a person she cares about (I assume) in a tough situation. Nope - it's all about her wants, and her feelings, and her insecurities, and her outrage, and her entire truckload of random bullshit that comes at the expense of a real person trying to be happier.  &gt;The night I found out that he was a RPer, I couldn't spend one more second with him. As soon as we got home, I just went to my room and cried. The whole time he was home, I just felt so uncomfortable around him. He went from my beloved brother, to being this horribly potentially abusive douchebag.  Gentlemen, meet the female psyche. Completely self-centered narcissistic garbage and all because her brother has a different worldview. What a selfish, entitled, spoiled brat.  If you see a woman like this, remember that they're completely incapable of independent thought - which makes them prime pump and dump targets while they're still hot. Never, ever, ever think about putting in any real time or effort to a woman who exhibits these levels of solipsism because all your efforts will be wasted. Find better women and expect better.
Ex2: I found TRP about 2 years ago during my first relationship in college.  After this breakup, I told her to get the fuck out of my place after witholding sex (also many gas lighting issues, sex wasn't worth it anymore especially with school work) I felt crushed but knew I would be fine in the long run.  It's funny because she immediately got an orbiter immediately after I dropped her.  I wasn't BP but I understood relationships as a transaction thanks to my father and talks we've had.  This isn't really my point.  I am still young (20).  I hadn't really applied, before this past year (2015), red pill principles and techniques into my life. So much to learn and apply, easier said than done.  However, I can say with the utmost confidence that TRP has changed every aspect of my life completely from school, social interactions, and my life perspective this year.  It may sound corny but I am very thankful for each member of the forum here.  Reading posts and learning from a variety of people about fitness, self esteem, motivation, social calibration, sexual strategy, and self improvement really helped direct me when I felt lost.  I understand that we all struggle sometimes and need helping hands.  This is a great place to reach out anonymously or gather multiple opinions.    The benefits of this community is extraordinary.  I am appalled by the flak this place catches for speaking cold hard facts.    This is just a quick+dirty thank you because its New Year's Eve, but I hope everyone has a better 2016 than their 2015.  
Ex3: Firstly I'd like to express my gratitude for the existence of this sub reddit. To all the contributing members offering their precious time and experience; thank you.   You've changed my life.   This will be my first post.  Prior to discovering TRP, I was as beta as beta can be. I let emotions rather than logic and constructive thought control my life. I put women on a pedestal, I struggled with my weight, I struggled with self control and self discipline etc. To be completely honest with you guys I hated myself. I was in the sick circle of depression which caused me to abuse food, drugs and myself. That further fueled the fire of my self hate.   The reason I'm writing this post is to not give you my sad story or to stroke my own ego with the story of current success thanks to TRP. I'm writing this post for those people that are in the same situation that I was not too long ago.   Depression and self hate are a cancer on the mind and body. It's a positive feedback loop that hijacks your mind and fills it with doubt, it clouds it and ultimately makes you ineffective at being an attractive and successful person. When you doubt yourself you take away the power of choice and will from yourself. A person unable to exert his will on his surroundings, or make a choice based on input and thought is in my opinion weak.   With that being stated I get to my point. The first thing you must do if you are in a place like I described is learn to love yourself. Sounds cliché but nothing quite rings as well as I'd like. Take note of the things you've accomplished, the things you can be proud of. This is your foundation and character. Focus on this instead of dwelling on your flaws and problems.   The next step is by far the most difficult. Make a decision that you must change. This is not easy. If you don't realize yourself that your actions are toxic and self destructive than you are doomed to repeat them. Once you've made that choice now use your new found positive character to force yourself to follow through on your choices.   How? Shame.   Once you start to realize that youre not happy with the way things are now and you love yourself; shame will become something you feel on a regular basis instead of self hate.   Shame that someone like me is overweight. Not I hate that I'm overweight.  Shame that I'm not utilizing my time productively at work. Not I hate how boring my job is.  Shame I dont go to the gym and maximize what I get from my body. Not I hate not having a defined body that turns heads.  Shame I waste hours of my precious time playing video games. Not I hate not having time. Etc. Shame I don't focus more on myself.  Shame I'm not keeping accurate track of the food I eat so it's mathematically fucking impossible to get fat again.  Shame... Shame...  Shame...   Shame will make you realize that youre the one to blame for your situation. Shame will drive you through the changes that need to take place.   TL;DR: If you respect yourself and love yourself then it's a fucking shame not to do better, period.     
Ex4: I recently read The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem and I thought it would be helpful to share some of the ideas here. Basically, self-esteem is defined by 2 factors:  * **Confidence in our ability to think, confidence in our ability to cope with the basic challenges of life.**  * **Confidence in our right to be successful and happy, the feeling of being worthy, deserving, entitled to assert our need and wants, achieve our values, and enjoy the fruits of our efforts.**  If you believe that the problems in your life can’t change no matter what you do and that you are not in control of your own decisions, then you have low self-esteem.   If you feel like you don’t deserve the credit people give you for your success or accomplishments, then you have low self-esteem.   While high self-esteem might not be something which our life depends on (like water and food). **Self-esteem is important for our well-being and happiness, it gives us the mental power to achieve great things and be successful in all parts of life.** Every man can increase his self-esteem by practicing:   **The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem**    **1. Living Consciously:** We are aware of what happens in our life and taking responsibility. It’s the ability to be able to stay congruent with your beliefs-values and act through them.    **2. Self-Acceptance:** Accept that you are not perfect. Nobody is born perfect, everyone has their own flaws. There is no point to start beating yourself because you are shorter than your co-worker. Instead, you must accept yourself for what you are. You might be short but the tall guy next to you might be bald and not like it either.   **3. Self-Responsibility:** It goes in hand with Self-Acceptance. It’s the continuation of that process. After you have accepted your flaws and mistakes. You now have to examine which of those you can actually improve and take action while stop worrying for those you can’t. You might not be able to overcome genetics but you can certainly improve your behavior, your haircut, your health and your body!  **4. Self-Assertiveness:** You stay true to your wants, needs, and values no matter the pressure you get from other people. It is the willingness to stand up for yourself even if sometimes what you do or believe is not so popular. “My life does not belong to others and I am not here on earth to live up to someone else’s expectations.” Men with low Self-Assertiveness fail shit-tests.  **5. Living Purposefully:** It means you are productive, that you take action every day to achieve your goals. Be specific, visualize what you really want in your life and make a plan. Measure your progress as you go on.  **6. Personal Integrity:** When we behave in ways that conflict with our judgment of what is appropriate, we lose face in our own eyes. We respect ourselves less. If the policy becomes habitual, we trust ourselves less or cease to trust ourselves at all. Integrity means congruence. Words and behavior match. For example: If you said today that you will go to the gym but you end up not doing it. You will lose some of your Personal Integrity, you will stop trusting yourself and what goals you set to yourself.  **Conclusion**  To the extent that the six pillars are integrated into our daily life, self-esteem is supported and strengthened. To the extent that they are not, self-esteem is undermined and subverted. One of the vital things The Red Pill teaches us is to respect ourselves, if we respect ourselves other people will follow.  
Ex5: I have dealt with Emotional issues from since I was a child.  I had a really ""difficult"" household, so I grew up insecure.   when you're parents are having a hard time expressing themselves in healthy ways because they themselves deal with emotional issues then they become overly critical and you as a child get to internalize self-criticism and this self-criticism is exactly what weakens your frame. you can call it ""self-shit test"".  the problem with critical parents is that up until age 8, their critical attitude traumatizes you and fills you with triggers that develop as you age and then you gather even more triggers and then you find yourself fear of rejection\ failure\ self-sabotage \ care too much about what other think\ etc.  the reason to all of those symptoms are those same traumas from childhood. you're not supposed to fear rejection THIS much. you don't suppose to fear failure THIS much and you're not supposed to be overly critical. all of those are emotional ""baggage"".  this emotional baggage make it difficult for you to concentrate and believe in yourself so you fail to achieve your goal and then you're self-esteem deteriorates and all of this makes you're frame weak and fragile.   to try and fake a strong frame is much harder than to heal those traumas and become actually strong. the way to do it is by using your imagination, people call this ""NLP"".   I went to therapy not so long ago which helped a lot and one of the exercises the therapist did, stuck with me and now I do it to myself because he just guided me through the visualization which I can do by myself and it works. it is a process but I am a living proof that it helps.   yesterday I found a book wrote by ""Tael swan"". she's an international therapist and she described the same exercise that the therapist did with me, and the book describes the theory behind it and explains step by step how to work with it.   for all of you, this can change lives. it goes father beyond just game and woman. your health depends on resolving those issues. so for those who want to become stronger the book called - ""The Completion Process"" by Tael Swan. (Kindle version is very cheap so everybody can afford it)

Ex1: Your parents tell you “never give up” yet you’ve never even had the opportunity to truly give up, how could you know what it means? Whether you’re working, studying or mastering a skill you are only giving 70% of your effort. How can you give up on something you never undertook? Your subconscious is always able to blame your lack of success on a lack of effort, not ability. For you, giving up is meaningless because you were set on that path since the day you started. Until you’re at the point where you have truly put 100% of your effort into something, yet you feel inadequate, you never need to apply the advice “never give up”. Your challenge was not one of persistence, simply of discipline. Your choice was never “should I give up or keep going” your choice was a joke, “should I get up and work or take a break.” You must always act after you’ve thought sufficiently regardless of whether you get to watch inspirational videos or not. Power comes in many forms but all succumb to one single form of power, will power. The power that gives birth to them all.  If you ever wanted to test your will power, I ask you to go on a retreat. Something that shows you who you really are, without any facades. The retreat lasts for 30 days. During your 30 days, you will avoid 3 major setbacks, that fuck up everything else in your life. The goal is to return your mind and body to their highest potential. Cut off snacking You will eat 100% healthy. No fast food, no candy, no alcohol, nothing of that sort. This is not a diet plan to lose weight. It’s a change of lifestyle, to get your body to its apex of performance.  Cut off masturbation and porn  Cut off unnecessary entertainment No more hanging out with friends, no more surfing online without a purpose. You will not waste time talking to friends about nothing.   If you are in school or university study as much as possible. Work out, play a sport, read or meditate when you are not. If you are working, push it up a notch. Make a list of goals you want to accomplish and burn yourself out chasing them. Dedicate yourself to a greater purpose. It’s only 30 days! Consider this an anti-vacation. There will be a follow-up video.   And there’s no “I’ll start on Monday” or “I’ll start on May first”. You start now!  https://youtu.be/c3Ka9QAblzE
Ex2: This is an update to this thread http://archive.li/p3rwY  The ride, although I realize now, merely at the very beginning, has been somewhat of a roller coaster of emotions. One the one hand, it has been humbling. More so, it feels like a purge of old ideas and conceptions, like I've been totally reset to a state where I am now presented with a bunch of bits and pieces of what I was, and now I have to put it all back together into a person. I still am kind of at odds as to what's my direction exactly, but it's fine. Because on the other hand, this feeling is exhilarating. I don't want to be poetic and cliche but I do honestly feel happy for the first time in years. It's like I was born again. I am more at ease with reality and myself, I take more pleasure out of the little things than I ever did. I feel alive and confident.  Last Sunday I went home and told her I want to break up. She wouldn't have it, cried her eyes off, pleaded, promised the whole nine yards. But I was committed to dumping her. Still didn't have the power to physically grab her by the shoulders and throw her out, so I kept saying I want to break up, she kept asking me to reconsider until we went to sleep. No sex was involved but she tried to hug me and cried a lot. Next morning I go to work, come home to the same exact scenario. Still wanted to dump her. She still wouldn't leave, I still couldn't actually throw her to the curb.  Next morning while she's at work, I pack some shit, take the dog to crash at my brother's for a couple of nights. So I'm off to work for the day and I text her she has 2 days to take all her shit out and leave. Then I went ahead and blocked her everywhere.  Two days, hundreds of messages of her asking for forgiveness and another chance later, she texts me she took everything and left.  So I take the dog and my shit and I go home.  While I was staying at my brother's I went back on Tinder and started making new friends on Facebook. I had been faithful to my ex for the entire time and I wanted to fuck. Started a few convos but wasn't prepared to to put in any considerable effort so I was only after easy pickings. Eventually I found on Facebook, a girl I had seen in a cafe a couple days earlier. I went for a quick beer and took a couple shots of her (i'm a photographer). So I send her a pic, start a convo, ask her over for a beer and she agrees.  She's this tiny 5 foot tall, 21 year old, 82 pound chick, kind of pretty with very nice boobs and a tiny little ass. I fuck her brains out, sleep it over and she's out. I felt nothing. The orgasm was ok, but I almost felt like I'd have been better off spending those few hours with myself. But hey, new pussy.  I signed a pre-contract to selling my studio apartment. I bought it in 2015 and am selling it now for a $5000 profit. I will be getting myself (and the doggo, too :) a bigger, nicer place.  I have a gym membership, started lifting about two weeks ago. At work I got another monthly bonus thing, so I guess I'm doing something good there as well.  I haven't spoken to or heard anything from the ex, nor do I have any such desire. I am finally confident I never want her or anything like this again, I realize it's been ENTIRELY my fault for allowing it to happen in the first place and surrendering any little power I had. I started listening to the Rational Male audiobook and my mind is blown.  Spring has come. I feel young. I feel powerful.
Ex3: I was surprised to see a bit of Red Pill Truth on the front page of the local news website the other day. While the article isn't perfect, it raises some very good points. As prevailing society continually redefines the role of men and their diminishes their value, it's no surprise that frustrated men lash out. Especially when they see their efforts fail after following the established path they are told is supposed to bring them happiness.  &gt;&gt; “It’s retribution — sometimes against the government, bullies or sometimes women — this notion that if you feel that you are ill-treated or emasculated, you can get back at these people by doing something that is powerful, that is hyper-masculine,”  http://national.deseretnews.com/article/6904/the-role-of-masculinity-and-mental-illness-in-mass-shootings.html
Ex4: I grew up as a very liberal white male. I campaigned for several prominent liberal politicians over the course of 10 years. I lived my life as a good complacent nice guy, and everyone who claimed to praise me for those same qualities and sacrifices took advantage of me. After years of apologizing for who I am, I finally realized that nothing will satiate those who seek to diminish my power so as to increase their own. Let me share the ideological realizations that opened my eyes.  There are only two types of people: Hammers and nails. Masters and slaves. The powerful and the weak.   When someone refers to your 'Privelege' they are talking about your 'power'. White power and male power are common themes here, and many outsiders can't understand how that could be the case. I was that person. How could you not understand how unjust it is, how horrible history has been for people? I challenged myself after some very negative person experiences with feminists and horrible racial diversity hires to look at that paradigm more deeply. What I realized is this: Power is the only thing that is real. Justice is an illusion used to redistribute power.   It is better to have power than to not have power. You cannot have both. Men cannot simultaneously serve the interests of fairness and be their true dominant selves. We can act like being just is in our best interest, but I challenge you to give someone absolute power over you and see if they care about your devotion to fairness. My feelings are reactionary and visceral because I feel them to be true deep in my bones. I can feel the power that good for nothing leeches have over me despite all the good will and sacrifice I put forward in an effort for justice in their name. I now see the real world: those with power dictate the rules of engagement. Never ever diminish your own power, lest you experience what it's like to be powerless.
Ex5: I would appreciate your thoughts on this self philosophy I've been developing.   So yah be an island unto yourself, sounds nice and all but what is that even supposed to mean. Well let's think about the concept of an island. A piece of earth capable of floating aboce sea level. That's you, your island is yourself, it looks like whatever you put into it. That is how the world will see you. Now the problem I faced for so many years was that I always wanted to leave my island. I use stories, people, or just sit on it and think about being sonewhere else. Whenever I got into a relationship I'd be super beta and try to live on their island. The problem with that is the more time you spend making her island better (ie: putting her on a pedistal). The shittier your island becomes, and of course you get broken up with in the end because while you've built a home in her lush jungles, deep caves, sandy beaches, and rocky mountians. Your island has been sitting there growing over, under cared for, and no depth. Who wants to stay on an island where you can see it all in two minutes?   Be an island unto yourself, grow out each tree, build up your mountians, dig out caves, clean up yoyr beaches, and when you feel lonely? Keep working. Cuz guess what? Sometimes islands lay untouched for years. But that doesn't stop them from growing. They don't sit around and wait for someone to care for them. They get better over time on their own. As an island you need to be ok with the fact that maybe you'll never have anybody stay on you. But that's when you gain power over the fear of being alone. That's when women will never have power over you. When you are an ialand unto yourself, then you choose who you want on your land. You choose what you want to show them and when.

Ex1: Tl;Dr: you need to put yourself out there earlier!  Body:  lotta ""beta"" guys complain that girls continually reject them in favor of having one-night-stands with chad.  but the unsaid truth is that beta guys are totally to blame for this. beta guys don't put themselves out there, they don't approach these girls when they're young and ripe. chads do, and from the perspective of a mousy girl, getting attention from a guy is an organic thing. they're not consciously going out and seeking out sex carnivals, it just happens because chad is outgoing and fun and is willing to show them new experiences while betas are not.  as young people, betas have nothing to bring to the table, they're just nerdy and not much fun to be around, and honestly they don't even like themselves very much. so they see what's going on, and instead of competing at chad's own game, they lock themselves in their rooms and study a lot, trying to chase degrees and careers to improve their status.  later on, when betas have acquired some professional success, they start to flaunt this success as a way to become confident with women, because they've had nothing else going for them. so what do women do? they notice the betas, and they notice the positive qualities they bring (career, etc.).  then the betas - who've grinded for the last decade, and climbed the corporate ladder, and finally have a girlfriend - they get extremely depressed and mad because they notice their girlfriends are kind of old now and they don't seem to like them that much and oh god they had so much fun before with other guys when the betas were locked away in the library!  but come on, you beta guys, what did you honestly expect? can you really blame the girls for this? take a deep look at yourself, and what you prioritized, and realize this was your own fault. maybe if you had taken some initiative when you were young instead of striving for a shitty career to flaunt, you could have had a girlfriend when you were younger instead of an old woman now who likes you solely for the career you flaunt.  Lessons learned: don't be bitter and focus on yourself and put yourself ojput there earlier
Ex2: **Introduction**  * Beta gets frustrated at women.  * Beta shoots white people.  **Body**  You can research this yourself as the news is uncovering how the African shooter in Dallas was actually a beta in the military.  He tried to give **Victoria's Secret** underwear to a female he wanted.  That's trying to gain attraction by being the *Beta Bucks* and he was frustrated and actually punished for this error.  **Conclusion**  Seen through a Red Pill lense what we were told was an action of supposed ""racism"" is actually a case of a Blue Pill beta freaking out.  He wanted to kill himself...  he was beta...  he redirected his failure towards an external political agenda.  *Five innocent people died because a guy didn't read the Red Pill.*  Don't let the bitches turn you into a killer.  ""Kill the Beta"" and make the world a better place.  &amp;nbsp;
Ex3: Simply put, it's time to reverse chicks tactics on us back on to them.   It is severely off putting and unattractive when a chick is using me as a beta bux option and is not truly attracted to me.   I've had 3 examples in the past week  I told one chick your too much in demand for me. Your out of my league we should be friends.  Another chick I called her out when she canceled a date and gave me a ""I'll let you know"" on a reschedule. I called her out basically saying the Brad Pitt rule you don't reschedule on Brad pitt etc and then I offer friendship.....she goes so your not attracted to me ? I go yeah,  about as attracted as you are to me....   The third one said she could only go on a date if she brought her kids. I said can't do it she said it's her only situation right now.   So instead of ignoring her I'll just tell her we can be friends.   .It literally drives them crazy and you have the upper hand because you, the little beta buck bitch are rejecting them and doing so in a perfect below the radar way that hits them at their core.   It is also good in case you want to expand your social circle, although these chicks are likely not to follow through as their only terms of friendship is for you to be her little beta whiteknight orbiter     
Ex4: The beta of the world is the true manipulator. The beta is truly the misogynist.    So much TRP hate, but this is what I assume to come from the ignorant. Those who are angry with those of us who frequent, or have frequented, The Red Pill are truly blind to the creation of the alpha. The analysis of the self one must go through to right his wrongs is too hard of a feat for most. I don't expect them to understand, that is why this message is to Red Pillers, and not to the rest of the world. And because the abandonment of the blue pill world is too hard of a feat for most, I don't blame the ignorant blue pill junkies stuck in fuck off land.   The beta is the true misogynist. He is unaware of his wants and needs. And because of his lack of self awareness, and the world around him, he spreads his confusion to women in his life like a bad disease. He can't tell whether he is coming or going, and lacks the ability to discern between his attraction for women and the chase of dopamine he seeks out from the women he pedestallizes. He is the one who needs to be taken for a ride, he is the one who walks into the frame of the fragile woman psyche.    He does not, and will not, leave women better than he found them. He allows them to walk all over him, in turn allowing women to believe this behavior is normal and becoming.   He manipulates women with guilt. And in turn he disgusts them, and leaves them feeling sympathetic and distraught. She develops a hate for the beta, and runs from this feeling, trying to remain on the CC as long as possible.   He mate guards and embarrasses women.    He makes his woman a mandatory secretary and becomes the furthest thing from her source of pleasure. She is ruined, and disgusted with the likes of this man. She cannot respect his beta ways. Thus, she does not feel willing to become a first mate... rather she feels obligated, an obligation that is temporary. For the beta, it is only a matter of time before he destroys their relationship and leaves her wanting to ride the cock carousel much longer than any other man could.    He'll act as a friend and change his intentions when he has nested in her life. He will embrace her masculine traits until he finds the one that leaves him the more feminine one of the relationship. He will ridicule and blame her... when it is his very actions that caused this from the start of their relationship.    He will guilt her with his provider traits, and make her lose more respect. The beta doesn't understand his woman, thus misinterprets her real messages to him. He will guilt her, and guilt her, until he is blue in the face, showing every one of his insecurities, causing the relationship to fail and her to develop hate.    He will constantly seek validation from her, creating more exhaustion. And when he is emotional, he will blame her and ridicule her for his emotions. It is hard work enough for her to act as the center of his life and entertainment.    He will ridicule her for being a woman, instead of he himself becoming a man.   The beta will never leave her better than he found her. In a world of beta dom, we are surrounded by women who believe this to be normal. Women who have become accustom to acting masculine and walking all over the beta men who lack self respect.

Ex1: **Summary:** This is a hard hitting response to the #DearDaddy feminist propaganda video that went viral last month (a rape culture video made by a charity called CARE Norway).  &amp;nbsp;  **Link :** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32GDOHN-ePI ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32GDOHN-ePI)  &amp;nbsp;  **Keynotes**  &amp;nbsp;    * The reason boys call girls bitches cunts and whores is because these kind of girls simply exist   * Adults should be responsible for their own safety, therefore if you get coma drunk in a public place, you deserve a part of the blame   * Women who trap their boyfriend with pregnancy are the most selfish mothers and should be shamed by society   * Domestic violence stories often have 2 sides, and men don’t start hitting women just like that for no reason   &amp;nbsp;  **Thoughts**  &amp;nbsp;  A cultural change is about to happen. If you look at the comments on the care video, you see that most people see it for what it is. If you pay attention to the latest news, you will also notice that the SJW war is spreading everywhere. Anti-feminism/ Anti SJW is going more mainstream, with guys like Milo and Bill Burr calling out feminist bullshit.   &amp;nbsp;  Side note: feminism has corrupted charities like Care Norway and others. If you go to their websites you will see they are now trying to invade poor African countries with their ideologies, while giving them money at the same time. They’re brainwashing poor children at a young age so they can’t defend themselves. Check out other charities like “because I am girl”, very telling.
Ex2: As a conservative/Libertarian type, one thing that makes my fucking day is to see leftists suffer the unintended consequences of their bullshit policies. Exhibit A for today: Women have been claiming for so long that they're equal to men in every way that people are starting to believe them. They celebrated winning the right to go into combat without really thinking through what that means. Par for the course for leftists. Now they're freaking out because the military has said, ""Great, so now that you're the equal of a man, you get to be eligible for the draft!""   What's especially great about this is that feminists are exposing themselves with their reactions. Many are blowing the whistle on themselves, saying ""Wait, feminism isn't about equality."" This is news to most everybody but us.   Also, it shoves their face into an uncomfortable fact - rights and privileges come with obligations attached. They've never understood this, but honestly, I think that this is our way out. They have to be made to realize this. Once they do, 99% of them will want to be housewives.   https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/02/02/army-and-marine-corps-chiefs-its-time-for-women-to-register-for-the-draft/
Ex3: Do you know what the saddest part is? Do you know who papered this bill in the parliament? A cuckolded AFC beta male MP. Jesus fucking christ a MALE !!  https://www.rt.com/news/345458-canada-anthem-gender-neutral/  Jesus fucking christ, man; I don't want to live in this fucking country anymore. Anyone that lives in Canada will know what I am talking about when I say that Canada is currently the epicenter of third wave feminism in this world.  Examples:  [Protesters shut down U of O professor's men's rights talk.](http://www.metronews.ca/news/ottawa/2014/04/10/protesters-shut-down-u-of-o-professors-mens-rights-talk.html)  [Man Faces 6 Months in Jail For Disagreeing With Feminists on Twitter.](http://www.infowars.com/man-faces-6-months-in-jail-for-disagreeing-with-feminists-on-twitter/)  [Feminists Go Crazy After Jian Ghomeshi Found Not Guilty Of Rape.](http://www.returnofkings.com/83865/feminists-go-crazy-after-jian-ghomeshi-found-not-guilty-of-rape)  And on, and on, and on, and on...  Let's not forget the 6's and the 5's walking in the downtown core pretending to be over entitled 10's all over the god damned place. Fuck this country.
Ex4: I've traveled all around, and also met people from all sorts of different countries and cultures, and I've definitely noticed a correlation. The places where feminists are the angriest, most ""oppressed"" and highest in percentage are the most liberal places where guys are the most blue pilled, passive and accepting of bad female behavior, such as Berkeley, San Francisco, and Los Angeles (all places I've lived in). These places usually also have a high percentage of single mothers, or if Dad was kept around, he allowed himself to be berated and dominated by Mom and the kids, so either way, kids were raised without a strong paternal figure to tell them when it's time to stop bitching and go be productive. Their daughters grow up to spend their lives crying about how men oppress them and abuse them all day, when in reality most of the men in their lives are sniveling wimps who duck their heads and apologize.  On the other hand, when I go to the South or meet women from non-Western countries, it's completely different. These are places that are still ""patriarchal,"" where men are openly sexist, still enforce submission in women and won't take their shit, and none of these women hate men, nor do they give two shits about feminism or believe in ""the Patriarchy,"" even though the societies they live in could very well be classified as one. They're actually happy with their place in society. And there are still plenty of smart, career-oriented women that come from these places, but they're still able to get along just fine with all the men in their lives without finding ways to get oppressed by them.   So, are the women in liberal places more angry, miserable and incapable of relating to males because the submissive, groveling Nice Guys they deal with are secretly oppressing them more than traditional men are? Or is the whole thing just their feminine way of expressing their frustration with the lack of true male energy and discipline in their lives, crying out for a strong hand to bitchslap them and tell them to shut the fuck up? This may be worth discussing, because it's very possible that the best way for men to beat feminism is for us to just...well...be men.

------------------------------

Ex1: **Summary:** I am a fan of dancing when I go out.  It is probably my favorite form of escalation; though it can be tricky to begin depending on various things (location, SMV, company, etc.)  These are strategies that have worked for me in terms of getting ladies to dance.  **Body:**  Have you ever been to a club/bar/locale and failed to enjoy yourself by dancing?  Here are some tips/observations that have enabled me to make the most of dancing on a night out.  * Find a place which has different music than the typical top 40 remix from a regular club.  Places that play salsa, cumbia, reggae, swing, and other atypical music usually have more people who are there to dance, instead of standing in a circle drinking with just your friends.  I personally love the sound of salsa so that's my go-to.  * These places usually offer a 1-hr lesson prior to the open dancing, for those of you who say you don't know how to dance.  You can take these skills everywhere.  I danced with a girl I met at a food festival because a salsa song was playing in the background, no prior interactions.  * These places are also good for practicing approaching for those who are not yet rid of the fear.  For some perspective, asking women to dance at a regular club works for me about 10% of the time vs. 99% at the salsa place.  It is a safe place for you nervous fellas to practice saying ""let's dance"" with confidence.  If you are at a mainstream club:  * Be loose, when you meet a girl and shake hands, groove to the music spin yourself around.  Most girls find this silly in a good way and will likely reciprocate when you spin them right after, boom, you're dancing with a girl.  This bypasses having to come up with some dumb intro in your head.  My success rate with this is about 50% after I spin her.  If it's going well after the first spin, I will throw in something like ""that was good, do it again slower"".  The benefits are many.  She is falling in your frame and she knows you are checking her out on the spin, which is good if she's already into it.  * If the girl you want is with friends (works best with 1 or 2), approach one of her friends and say ""may I borrow your dance partner real quick?"" eyes on the friend, hand on the elbow of your girl.  Girls are quick to say no when asked to dance by strangers, but they are more often willing to send their friends off with someone.  If the friend is cool with you dancing with the girl (which is the case more than I thought), the girl will be more likely to comply.  Sometimes you get some resistance from the girl (e.g. ""I can't dance"" or ""I'm with my friend"").  Reply with ""I don't know either!"" ""I know 2 moves"" ""come on it ain't gonna kill ya!"".  If said with confidence, that resistance is not too tricky.  The ""borrow from the friend"" strategy also has ~50% success rate in my experience.  **Conclusion** Location and music is big if you want to dance, select with thought, I've seen the dumpy men with a hottie of a dance partner because the guy is a master dancer.  If you are at a mainstream club, these were two strategies that have increased my dancing success substantially.  Tell me [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0OOmP_VMhI) doesn't look like a blast.
Ex2: This summer I realized that learning how to dance is more important than I once thought it was, so I decided to take one 2 hour ballroom dancing class at a community college.  At the class, the instructor asked us who do we think should lead while ballroom dancing.  Me and a few of the other boys said that the guy should take the lead while dancing.  A feminist girl I know objected quite vehemently, so the instructor  placated her a bit to soothe her hamster.  I got paired up with a black HB7 whom I'll call Maddy.  I decided that I would try to test out a few TRP theories, but I would not close the deal as she was too young for me.  While we were in dancing positions, Maddy tried to take the lead, but I wouldn't let her.  Because of this, she decided to try to shit test me a bit.  Maddy: So you think that you are going to take the lead without asking me my opinion?  Me: Yes.  Maddy: And do you think I'll be okay with that?  Me: It doesn't matter if you are okay with it or not, I'm taking the lead.  That shut her up for awhile.  She tried to take the lead again while we were dancing, but I overpowered her and gave her a stern look of disapproval and quietly but powerfully whisphered, ""No.""  We she started to get a hang of the moves, I said, ""You're finally getting it!""  And she would say in reply, ""No, we're getting it!""  After about 30 minutes into the lesson, Maddy said:  Maddy: So OP do you not think that a woman cannot lead in a dance?  Me: I'm sure that YOU could lead in a dance if you wanted to.  Do you want to lead?  Maddy; Oh! No, no, I'm fine with you still leading me.  After that encounter she was like putty in my hands.  She smiled and looked into my eyes the whole time through.  When I was leaving, I heard her talking to her friends about how I ""Crushed her soul.""  That comment brought a smile to my face.  tl;dr Ballroom dancing is a great place to see TRP in action.  Women don't want to lead, they want you to lead them.
Ex3:  I wanted to share my experiences how dance helped me to hook up more easily with some girls and how it can possibly help you. I think there is belief that dancing is beta activity  but if you use it right it can be pretty effective. So I will just point out advantages.  •	Escalating things physically much faster-you can pretty much eliminate prefuck conversations and  get a shortcut to the making out . I usually just dance with girl and see how she responds to little more wilder dancing  and if you have green light  just transition to making out and later fucking.   •	Your game can be little of-this basically comes from point one because you are practically eliminating prefuck conversations   •	You dont have to be pro to be seen like one- I dance salsa and bachata and you can seem very impressive for non dancing crowd even if you are not that good. Basic steps are easy to catch and with some spins it can look really good.   •	Showing skill and confidence- many chics actually dont know how to dance so from the start you are performing activity where you much better than her and most importantly you are willing to show her what you know   •	Sexual tension and plausible deniability- its easy to establish sexual tension and by dancing you give her plausible deniability so her antislut defense wont come into play cause you are just dancing right? ;) So thats all by now if you have some valuable experiences feel free to share.  
Ex4: **Summary:**  Invited HB8 I wanted to bang to come dancing with a group of mutual friends. She asked if her FWB could come. I said no, she came alone, we hooked up.  **Body:**  There is a HB8 who is close with some of my friends and she had shown many IOI to me in the past when I was not single. Being recently single, I put together a night where we planned on going out dancing at a bar, starting the night at my house with drinks, music, and card games. Told my friend to invite HB8 and to make it known I’m interested in her.  She accepted the invitation but asked if her FWB could also join the party. My friend texted me asking what he should say, since he knew my intentions with her. I told him to say no and to let her know I was looking forward to dancing with her.  I decided it would be best to maintain my frame and let her know exactly what my intentions are, and if she wanted to spend time with that guy over me that she wouldn’t be worth my time that night anyway. I wasn’t about to compete with some other guy in my own home.  After my friend told her no, she said that she preferred that her FWB didn’t come, but she needed a ride to my house and FWB offered to drive. We handled the transportation for her and had a great night, ending with hours in the bedroom and me getting very little sleep.  It was such a good time partying at my house that we didn’t even make it to the bar.  **Lessons Learned:**  * Maintain frame. If you have a DGAF attitude and let her know exactly what your intentions are it will work out if she’s interested.  * If you keep your guests entertained and taken care of at a small party (~5-10 people) you will look like a boss. I had a stocked bar, food, mixers, music and games on lock down, and the ladies loved it. The girls were all dressed up for a night out but ended up saying that they had more fun at my house and didn’t regret skipping the bar at all.  * Bonus Lesson: Preselection is real. My friend brought a girl (HB9) he was trying to hook up with but at the end of the night she was giving me IOI even though it was obvious me and HB8 were into each other. The next day she asked my friend for my number, texted me, and wants to hang out soon. Poor guy needs to start lifting.

------------------------------

Ex1: One of the most predictable reactions when someone breaks free of blue pill condtioning, and begins to truly see the world for what it is, is anger. The term used to describe this initial stage of freedom on here is ""The Anger Phase."" Whilst most would say that anger is a temporary thing, eventually fading away, as u/redpillschool pointed out in his excellent post, anger really isn't a phase. Nor should it be, really. Anger is good. What isn't healthy, however, is bitterness.   There often exists a conflating of anger and bitterness. After all, bitterness usually stems from anger that found no outlet and festered, turning from the potentially useful potent energy of rage to the dormant rancor that harms only the person it inhabits.   It must be understood that only one thing separates the angry man from the bitter man:action. Anger, when used as it was meant to, fuels you to make decisions and take action to effect change. This drains the energy from the anger, but emotions are perfectly capable of re-filling, and when it does, you get that extra kick in the rear end again--always in a good way. When no action is taken, the anger turns on itself and hardens and coagulates into a poisonous substance.   The argument can be made that one really ought to let go of anger at some point, and if that works for you, then good. For many,though, anger is just what the red pill doctor ordered, and it provides the impetus to creating a life in line with what you truly want.   In more relatable terms, anger is the old man who plants thorn bushes around his lawn so the kids won't ruin his grass. Bitterness is the other old man who just sits and watches his lawn get ruined whilst mumbling about how kids today have no respect. Both recognise the situation for what it is, but only one processes it in a manner that will allow them to change and come out on top..   Anger is dynamic. Bitterness is stagnant.
Ex2: White knight judge shows great understanding and compassion for homicidal mother in NYC.   http://nypost.com/2016/05/18/city-teacher-who-poisoned-drowned-her-kids-gets-8-years-in-jail/  I'm still in the anger phases but this is amazing to me.   Maybe this will be a new trend for divorcing women to kill their kids in the rare instance they don't get their way in court and judges signing off on it. Plus parents of her students even donated to her defense. This would never happen for a man.  I'm curious what TRP thinks if such compassion for emotionally turmoil would ever be offered to a man going through a divorce or other life change.  
Ex3: To be to totally honest I thought I skipped the anger phase, I really did. Sure I was pissed when it came crashing down that being a white knight would only fuck me in the end but I moved past that when I realized the measurable improvements I could make to my life to course correct.  Then  I dug my teeth into the rest of the side bar theory reading. I'm barely 3 pages into The Misandry Bubble and I want to fucking scream. How the flying fuck could I be so blind as to the divorce rape that's happening and the vomit inducing inequality of divorce laws. How the fuck can feminism even think to make claims that it wants equality of genders when it allows this shit to happen? I knew feminism was bullshit, but what I didn't understand that it's from a place worse than hell for any man affected by it.  This is injustice in the truest sense and it's sickening. Suffice to say I'm glad I found the red pill  Edit: added flair
Ex4: I read frequently TRP and also other ""men's issues"" subs. Many posts in there show the glaring bias against men and show situations where men are put in a bad situation just because of their gender. This causes me to be angry instantly, which is a normal reaction.  Many times I have gone through the day, the week thinking about all those things and trying to make up in my brain a way to fix it. That caused more anxiety. Sometimes a need for revenge.  Obviously for most guys this boils down to nothing, just go back focusing on your daily duties. A few would expose this anger and revenge by nothing more than not going out for lunch with that female co-worker or acting as a jerk. However, a very few would possibly make the worse, like hurting someone. And here is what I have to say to you. Do not be mad that things are like they are, because:  1. Women are biased by genetics. They just cannot escape their jerk behavior because it is coded in their DNA. This will never change because it is rooted in biological reasons.  2. Women are stupid. When she comes to you asking to fix that faucet, it is not because she is entitled. It is because she just cannot do it. Women have very low spatial reasoning and have a hard time figuring out the 3D world.  3. Women need protection. And when I say ""need"" means they cannot live in this world without adult protection. They are physically weak. They are scared the entire day. That is why feminism degenerated these days to ask for MORE state protection to women, not less like the feminist's call in the 70s, Camille Paglia comes to mind.  4. Women do not have motivation to succeed - in average. Because of the low-T, their drive to fight - literally and mentallly - is very low. They cannot aspire to the top CEO position because that will require 80 hours/week and intense discipline to achieve. They know the only way to get to the top is with government intervention.  5. Women live scared all the time because they know they are weak, stupid, slow, without motivation.  When you free yourself from the chains of feminism, ie believing that women are as capable as men, is that your anger will subside into pity and understanding of the reality as it is.

Ex1: **TLDR:** Looks aren't that important when it comes to getting a girlfriend or relationship. But for becoming a player and banging as many girls as possible they are very important and a huge part of your SMV. Women view men as either a Lover or a Provider.   **Body:**  If you walk around anywhere, you'll see plenty of guys who are just plain unattractive with a girlfriend on their arm. I have friends who aren't even a 5/10 in the looks department but can easily get a sexy girlfriend.   **I'm certainly not saying looks don't matter because that is complete nonsense.** Looks matter and they are a huge part of your SMV. And I will admit that if you are good looking, you will have more options for dating and sex.  However, women look at potential boyfriends differently. From a different mindset completely.   They are looked at as **Beta Providers**. They think more along the lines of """"What can this guy do for me, how can he benefit me?"""" This is why Betas are generally undersexed and unsatisfied. The girl isn't turned on by them, but she has no issue dating him because the attention and gifts are nice.   Women think of Men as either Providers or Lovers.  The Lover has to be good looking, alpha, you know the gist. The provider, just has to be nice and available to that woman.   I'm not writing this post to tell you that you should embrace the provider role just so you can get a girlfriend. I'd never want to be a pathetic provider nice guy.   This post is more about explaining how women view men differently.  From an evolutionary standpoint, a woman wants a man who can provide for her and take care of her. This is why being a Provider can get you a girlfriend. **But don't be surprised when your LTR cheats on you with a good looking alpha.**   While a provider can have good looks, generally speaking it doesn't matter as much. She might even assume he wouldn't be a good boyfriend simply because he's good looking. And women assume good looking guys will not be faithful.   **Conclusion:** Women either look at you as a potential meal ticket, (Provider) in which case looks don't matter very much. Or they look at you as someone they want to fuck, a good looking guy (Lover). This idea was also sparked by a video from RSDTyler, [link here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGEO6ig8WsM)   Sidenote: There is an exception though for really good looking women. I'm talking about 9s and 10s. They are much more picky and are rarely seen with an unattractive guy unless he's very wealthy and high status. 
Ex2: I've read on TRP that women are attracted to a man's capacity for violence.  I would like to qualify that statement with, women are attracted to the degree that men do not act on their capacity for violence.  This is why we observe that just being a nice guy isn't good enough, you had no other option.   That is why Ghandi preaching peace, or some neckbeard praising faithfulness is really not virtuous. One isn't turning a vice into a virtue if they never had the capacity for the vice, it's a coverup of weakness.   I'm normally a serious person. I was sitting in a park with a girl I was seeing, we weren't talking because we were sunbathing and she broke the silence to say that, """"You make me feel safe."""" That's the favorite compliment out of all the ones i've ever received.   A girl feeling safe and secure around you is the biggest turn on for her, sometimes money accomplishes this.  Girls want a man who is A. capable of protecting her, but at the same time B. capable of wrecking somebody who threatens her. They don't want an asshole who abuses them, but girls tend to choose these guys because they want to fix them instead of just finding a """"nice guy."""" They see perceived value and try to make it into what they need. 
Ex3: I use public transport a lot. Sitting on a bus/subway car is incredibly boring, so you end up doing a lot of people watching.   Earlier today on the subway, I saw a rather unattractive woman. She looked like she was in her mid 40s, quite overweight, weirdly dressed - just your textbook white trash. She was with another slightly older looking woman who was similarly unattractive (I later discovered this was in fact, the other woman's mother).   Some guy came up to them and started making conversation. He wasn't particularly attractive or charming, but hell - he's talking to a bunch of land whales. He was doing great - they were laughing, the younger one was dropping very obvious hints that she's interested. It looked like a pretty much done deal.  That is, until a few stops later - he asks her if she's married, she says she's divorced but has kids blah blah blah, and this guy proceeds to just completely shoot himself in the foot. He starts going on about how he's never had a girlfriend, girls never give him a chance - the usual incel lamentations. You could quite literally see her interest completely fizzle out with this sob story.   Let that sink in - this man was turned down by a **40 something obese single mom who was all over him 5 minutes ago.** Why? """"Nice guy game"""" or """"sympathy game"""" or whatever you want to call it doesn't work. I see this unbelievably often - I've had girls show me screenshots of tinder convos that basically go from """"hi"""" to """"I'm going to die alone because girls never give me a chance, will you give me a chance?"""" in 2-3 lines, and unsurprisingly it never ends with the guy actually getting laid (more often than not, she'll be showing your convo to everyone she knows and laughing about it)  I wanted to share the example from today not because it's a concept I think most TRP readers would be unaware of, but mostly because I wanted to demonstrate just how much of a game killer this is. If you can't keep a landwhale welfare queen's interest, you need to seriously, seriously reevaluate your strategy. But of course, he probably won't, and will probably add this to the list of sob stories of how girls won't give a 'nice guy' like him a chance.   tl;dr - You are a P I M P with a capital P, even if you're not. Don't forget it. ""

"
2,Relationships,"Ex1: Here's a little field report for you guys.  Today I was chilling with my friend at his pizza shop. I see these two young chicks sit down at a table outside and immediately noticed the HB8 brunette. I developed a quick game plan and walked over to them and said hey. Then I asked the brunette, ""what are you doing at *so and so shop*, aren't you a model?""  She blushed up and they both giggled, she said ""thanksssss, I'm not a model thooooo"". I then sat down with them and introduced myself and asked for her name. We started chatting about college and shit and I basically was just playing with her because she was clearly nervous/blushing and it was too easy to tease her and pry for answers. Neither of them were adding any substance to the conversation and it was getting stale.   Here is where I fucked up. I should have immediately asked her on a date or for at least her number. Instead I just kept shooting the shit and eventually her friend said ""we should head out."" I just sat there with absolutely no reaction and they peaced out. At first I just sat there thinking I had been rejected...downright stood up. But I sat there and thought about it.   **Lessons I learned** My failure was not her fault at all, I simply failed to escalate. I had been given a chance, she had given me the shit test of time. I ran the clock too long and maybe she assumed I was trying to be platonic. But my opening line clearly opposed that, so she picked up on it and ended my chance.  
Ex2: Recently, I've been working on cold-approaching girls and ""daygaming"".  The point of the post isn't to go over the details or give a field report but to share a quick thought on women.  Recent activity:  - Girl 1 (18) is in the same queue at the train station and it's very busy/slow. I'm looking around, in a happy-go-lucky mood and smile at this girl and she smiles back. We each buy our tickets and I walk over to her on the station platform to say hi. As there's only a minute before she gets her train, I just take a number.  - Girl 2 (19) is outside a pub smoking (I hate smokers but wanted to say hi anyway) by herself as I'm walking back from the gym. I say hi and make some comment about her daydreaming and looking lost. She giggles and we talk for a little bit. She goes back inside so I get a number and carry on walking home.  - Girl 3 (21) is in a normal pub/club. An awesome friend of mine chats to a hot girl in a group of three girls. I come over to talk to the other two - one is really cute and one is chubby. I already had quite good social proof at this place with some female friends that happened to be out that night too. I make them both laugh, isolate the cute girl with the help of a female friend talking to the chubby girl, make out and get a number.  So, pretty good by all accounts. Nothing too crazy here, just a few numbers really. Importantly, there was no real investment on my part as I was doing my own thing anyway on each occasion.   Now the point of my post:  *Each of these girls turn out to be absolutely crazy*  I met Girl 1 in the park where I live and got her to come to my place (conveniently next to the park.. almost like I'd planned that..). As she starts telling me her life story, she tells me she's on all sorts of medications and sleeping pills etc. Not really something I want to be attached to.  I met Girl 2 in a wine bar close to where I live. She's lovely by all accounts but is the super-excitable type. As in, it takes effort to keep up with just her talking. Not particularly thrilling conversation as it was more of a monologue on her side (which is good as she's investing in me but hard work). On the scale of sane-to-bat-shit-crazy, I'd place her near the right-hand end of the spectrum.  I text girl 3 to meet up and she says she can't because she has anxiety issues and sometimes can't leave the house. We continued the conversation and I believe she does have anxiety issues or is a really good liar. Either way, not something I want to be attached to.  To summarise:  I meet 3 girls in completely different scenarios of the ~20 age group. I find them all a bit mental.  Lessons learned:  - You get more opportunities by opening more people (of course) - All girls have the potential to be crazy (I'm hopeful they aren't all that bad) - Be picky - Don't derive your satisfaction from girls  
Ex3: Met this girl off tinder (HB7) and while I've had success with this in the past. I had never really consciously thought through the process as I did this time using what I've learned here.   **Saturday**  Met her at a coffee shop at 1PM, early enough so that she could get comfortable and if we met up later that night I could close her on the same day. I was already going to be there working so I messaged her to come join me for a coffee break.   * she walks in, I go for the hug intro, there are 2 couches she chooses to sit on the couch next to me. (I moved my crap previously and made it inviting to sit there) * I had already had a coffee so she gets up and grabs one, I do not follow or stand with her in line, I relax on the couch and keep reading something on my phone * we talk, keep it light, at some point I move over to touch her on her leg * we then go for a walk in the freezing cold as I wanted to check this one place out nearby I had heard about * it's a pretty small town so we run into people we both know * once we get to this part of town that's pretty empty I go for a kiss, she knew it was coming as she took her sunglasses off, no ""would you like to kiss me or any type of statements"".  * the kiss was ok, she was hesitant (I classified it as a ""maybe"") and she thanked me right after * she then had a phone call to make and I could have hung around but ended it there, she said ""ok we can do this again"" and I laughed, ""ok""  Messaged her later to ""do this again"" tonight. She was busy suggested Sunday.   **Sunday**  * went for a drink at a cool bar that was going to close in 2 hours so we would have a reason to leave * no food, just beers, we split the bill * she kept asking me the basic ""how many bros/sis do you have?"" etc, I kept flipping and said we should tell fun stories that tell something about us * flirting small talk, escalated with putting my hand on her leg, moving it up, pulling away for a bit, coming back, then I came up with some funny reason to check out my place and she said ""not this instant"". * were both a little buzzed I swiveled her bar stool and put her legs inbetween mine, smelled her neck, kissed her. She got nervous because there were other people there, the kissing was way better (yes) * then I suggested we go back to her place because I was having a good time and didn't want her to be nervous  **The close**  In my mind, I know why I'm there, she knows why I'm there, no BS, just get it on. Was fun, however I couldn't get hard for round 2, I think it has something to do with the claritin d I took earlier. She tried to turn me on, did the things that normally would get me going again. At that moment I alternating touching her, fingering her, etc till she came. After that she kept asking me how new my shirt was, and ""nice hat"", ""nice belt"", ""that jacket is really nice"". Also at some point asking me where I went to school, she couldn't figure me out, ""ski bum?"", ""???""  Here's one sample question I also got and what I said since I didn't want to answer. (she has a masters)  her ""so did you goto school, like masters or other?""  me ""would it matter if I told you I didn't finish college?"" her ""nah just curious"" blah blah other convo.   At the end she thanked me for coming over. Very appreciative.   **Update**   A few of you have asked me about my clothes. I was going for good looking but not expensive. I don't want her to see my jacket and go oooh that's expensive, or oh wow this guy must be loaded. Here's what I wore: collared long sleeve blue heathered shirt (not tucked in), dark wash jeans, belt with alternating warm colors, brown leather boots, 2 tone jacket. Dressing well doesn't mean breaking the bank. Dress well and what you are comfortable in.  I believe her compliments in the end were IOIs. 
Ex4: Just graduated college where we were an LTR. Now we're in different cities. I told her that we were no strings attached, and that when we see each other, we would have fun.  Now that I arrive, and am in her bed making out, she goes ""You're going to hate me for this. But there's someone else. We haven't done anything [trickle truth I'm sure], but this weekend I just want to be friends. Is that ok?""  I say ""No."" and awkward smirks are exchanged. All sexual escalation stops as I'm just dumbfounded.  We just had dinner and are making plans for the night. Kino is at an unprecedented low. The thing is, I'm supposed to be staying here all weekend. I'm quickly looking for other friend's places I could stay with in NYC.  Please give me advice. I'm in an essentially foreign city staying with a now broken plate. I know I've made mistakes. Feel free to explain them so that I may grow.  I posted this on asktrp, but there isn't much traffic. Feel free to delete. I'm hoping for some help.  Do I try and escalate for tonight, and if it doesn't work out stay with someone else? I know you can't negotiate desire, so an ultimatum may not be the best move, but it might work.  Immediate actionable advice preferred. Thanks!     UPDATE AND MORE DETAILS: After an awkward evening with minimal kino in her apartment we were going to bed. The whole time I was contacting buddies to find a place to crash. One came through, and I left while she (pretended?) seemed to be asleep. I stayed the night, but I have to return for my luggage. She texted me this morning ""where'd you go?"" I haven't replied.   Furthermore, she invited me to a company dinner tonight where, even after the ljbf, she seemed excited to show me off to her friends. She kept insisting how we were gonna super drunk and it was going to be so much fun with all of these after parties and now she needs me to keep up with her on the drinking. She's a consultant on wall st. so this is extravagant stuff with suits.  I figure she could act as preselection while I game other women at her company. I believe by the end of the night, she'll be more than willing to f-close again. I just need to maintain frame.   Regardless, I'm leaving tomorrow. I have family about an hour outside of the city who's more than happy to see me.  Do tell if you see anything wrong or if I should do something different.
Ex5: Hi TRP, I wanted to share a fresh story with all of you. It just happenned so you will get all the juicy details.  So I'm part of a debating society at my college, and there's this hb8 that I happenned to work on a project with. She has a bf (Cuck), who is also part of the society. Tall, handsome, elegant and well-spoken. I thought she'd never even look at me. Boy was I wrong.  So we were out once, celebrating a breakthrough on our project, and I notice she's clearly giving me IOIs. Frankly, she didn't even know it but the moment we decided to work together she was as subtle as a WWE wrestler in ballet class. Me being me, 6-7 but not jacked/perfect face, I had my doubts but wanted to wait and see if she wasn't just fucking with me. (Well, she was a short while later lol)  So we go and celebrate, when we get out of the bar there aren't any trains left so she asks if she could catch a Uber to my place. I have a moment of ""wtf."" then proceed to accept her generous offer. Back at my place she takes some kind of medication for a condition she has, which happen to be very strong painkillers that she says ""Play with her mind"" a.k.a plausible deniability.   We watch a movie, and I lean in for the kiss (some kino before). She then says ""I had no idea you found me attractive!"" Yeah right lol, free validation but it's for the greater good.  For several weeks we meet at my place, and she's actually quite smart apart from being hot, so good times are had. I was worried her bf would find out but she just wants the D so she's telling things like ""he also cheated!"", ""we're taking a break"", ""he doesn't love me"" etc. a.n. In other words, you guessed it, hamstering. She lied to C as well, and not just one time.   Anyway, I was prepared to face the consequences of my actions, and I knew that sooner or later she would spill it. So fast forward to today, when her bf messages me on fb (didn't even have him as a friend so lucky for him I saw his request) and says we need to talk. I say okay, let's meet.  We meet and Cuck starts to explain with watery eyes how I destroyed a pure and true love, he asks if we did it again after the first night (she only told him about that, and specifically asks me not to further the matter) and I say no, he insists and tells me to swear on my manly honor, I lol in my head and say no. He actually shaked my hand after that and took it like a champ.    *RP truths witnessed :*  - She will lie. - She will eventually talk. - She doesn't care if you climb Mt. Everest for her, if there's no more tingles you're cucked.  - Do not invest as much as this guy did. I actually feel bad for him, stoic pragmatism put aside. - Do not try this kind of shit if it's detrimental to your SMV. Do not shit where you eat. - If he hadn't been a cuck he would have messed me up, so lift.   *Lessons learned :*  - Short-term vs. Long-term : weigh out your benefits from pursuing a one-time pussy vs. getting constant SMV from your hobby. - If you cuck someone, make sure you actually don't know the guy. It makes lying to his face so much easier.  *Disclaimer :*  I do not condone cucking nor lying if it's not in the context of pursuing an LTR. It's just not worth it, bro, and Marcus Aurelius is shaking his head in Elysium. On the other hand, the poor guys may just wake up so do as you please.

------------------------------

Ex1: The other night at dinner, when my grandmother walked away for a minute to check on the laundry, we were talking about marriage when he dropped this  on me:   *I have a theory. My theory is that when a woman is secured in her marriage, I think there's this chemical that drips and drips and drips when you both are dating that makes her want to suck and fuck your brains out all the time. But, however, when she becomes secured and settled, has some kids and is living the ""marriage life"" that chemical slowly stops dripping and becomes more of an exchange of goods. She knows you want sex and he knows she wants a commitment. And that's marriage my boy, an exchange in goods and services.* I then ask ""why did you get married?"" He then replied *Because we know how this game works. She makes sure our sex life is good and makes sure I have food in my stomach and she knows that I am a good provider and will care and love her for the rest of her days. We take care of each other and out of that comes love and a successful marriage.* (They have been married for 22 years btw)   Not really a long post boys. Just some grandfatherly advise.
Ex2: From what I've gathered about red pill philosophy in general, only betas settle for one mate, whereas alphas never have to marry because a free and endless supply of sex from young, beautiful women is always open to them. Yes, Trump married a super model, but that's still settling for one monogamous partner when in ancient times rulers had harems of up to hundreds of willing women to select from at his whim. I understand that presidents are expected to be ""family men"" and uphold other socially conservative roles as a positive role model for the average American male. Though remember that Kennedy had his side thing with Marilyn Monroe and Jackie didn't even blink, as any good wife lucky enough to be married to an alpha should behave. Maybe this is also part of the reason why the CIA decided to go through with his assassination: on top of all the other trouble he was causing, he got to bang Marilyn, which of course made them jealous. The man's greatness was his own downfall to an aftermath of history controlled by beta cabals.
Ex3: You hear ""don't get married"" often around these parts, which is arguably justifiable as women are no longer fit to marry, so men will increasingly opt out rather than making the best of a bad situation.  But that's like saying ""don't drive""; you're not offering a viable alternative to the problem of lack of procreation.  Spinning plates does not leave a genetic legacy.  Some of us care about that.  If the native population declines, America will be overrun like the Roman Empires was by barbarian hordes during its decline and fall.  There may be outside forces that are salivating at this potential development, but more likely the problem will stem from masses of migrants fleeing poverty, famine, violence, and increasing global temperatures in the equatorial zone.  Unlike the Roman Empire however, we can physically prevent potential invasions as we have natural barriers...except on the south, which thankfully is the shortest border, facilitating the effort of blocking it.  That's practically the only reason Trump's been popular.  I've watched crowd reactions to several of his stump speeches around the country, and I noticed that people mostly tune out everything he says except for ""build the wall"".  But the real benefit of the wall isn't for the present day so much as it's for the potential future a few decades from now, when Americans individuals are even weaker and less masculine due to beta-fication, and less numerous due to men's abandonment of marriage.  So the wall would need to be built to last, if that's practical.  As a ostensibly patriotic American who thinks about the fate of future generations of this country, probably because I'm an unsuccessful, old omega (early 40s) who has nothing better to do except thinking of this kinda shit often since I'm not laying any pipe or consuming much goods, that is my explanation of why ""don't get married"" and ""build the wall"" are twin mantras that go together like peanut butter and jelly.  Thanks for listening.

------------------------------

Ex1: The ""love of your life"" is a myth. Like earth being the centre of the universe, or us being the apple of god's eyes, or the existence of life after death. All myths we are so prone to believe because they shield us from the (otherwise apparent) horror of reality: the fact that as living organisms, we are essentially alone among other mostly self-serving organisms, insignificant in the grand scheme of things, and finite in time.  The reality in the case of ""love"" and ""relationships"" is that you current ""significant other"" is out there for herself first, her kids second, and some source of security third. She doesn't love you; she loves the fact that being with you make her feel good/loved/secured/protected/high-status, etc. And the day you don't make her feel that way anymore (which comes quickly), and that in the context of the list of priorities written above, the benefits of leaving you outweigh the benefits of staying, then she will have no reason to stay and rationalise that she doesn't love you, or ever did..   This does not mean that there is no chance of you ever growing old and dying together, it just means that you have no way to ensure that it will happen. And that if it does happen, then you've been bloody lucky.  Just like with the other myths, the only way to solve the dissonance between reality and your wants is to drop the delusion and face reality dead on. These myths are just myths; Reality is harsh; it's ok, we'll be fine anyway. Buddhists have been fighting the delusion of permanence for millenia, you can just as well fight the delusion of lifelong love. It just requires to repeat the mantra: ""She's not yours; it's just your turn; enjoy it while it's your turn"".
Ex2: The goal of today is to help you figure out queues and triggers so that your conscious mind can realize when your unconscious mind is ""falling in love"".(catching the itis)  It's also about making sure that the twitterpation you've caught doesn't affect the rest of your habits and social life.  You must keep it separate and in it's own hierarchy that is subordinate to your everyday routine and healthy habits.   What you want to do is figure out your symptoms.  Think back to the last girl that took a hot shit on you.  What'd you think of her?  What'd you say to her?  What'd you say to other people about her?  Did you talk about her often? How many times a day did you think about her? What words did you use to describe her?  For me personally one symptom I've caught privy to is that I will use words other than cute, smart, pretty to describe a girl I've got the itis for.  Another one is that my word choice becomes masochistically poor around the person.  Your symptoms might be the same.   Congratulations you caught the itis.  You're in love.  What do?   The most important thing you must do is critique her in your mind.  Continue to do this over and over.  Look for flaws in the physical, in the mental, in the social.  As many as possible.  The reason for this is when the itis sets on you it becomes very very difficult to do this.  I had a friend who was head over heels for a girl.  Talked about how beautiful she was nonstop.  Well months later he's got a foot in the door and he sends us a picture of her.  Tell me why we roasted his ass.  That bitch looked like a man and he was too charmed to see it.  Furious at us he went no contact for quite a while.  It's inevitable that you will ""fall in love"", but you must keep that piece of how you think about that person separate from how you view the person as a whole.  Have you ever heard people say things like, ""Yeah he's a good guy, he's just slow/smells bad/impulsive.""  It's how you should view girls you like.  Phrase your thoughts about her in your head in this manner.  It'll help you to keep a level head and reduce anxiety, because it'll keep her humanized in your mind and not goddess like.  Biology can't be completely beaten, but it can be controlled.  So how did you attack your own itis, delicious?  For shits and gigs tell us what's ugly af about a girl that charmed you lately.  Well she's super short, with a great body, but her teeth are more jumbled than a 7 year old's lego collection.  To be honest I don't even know how her teeth can grow like that.  It is ridiculous.  It look like her teeth got an outpost tooth on the lookout for plaque and shit.  There you go guys.  TL;DR Roast the girls you love and care about the most so that you don't build up an imaginary version of them that isn't at all a good representation of who they are.  Thereby keeping the pussy off the pedestal.
Ex3: Love develops after lust. If you don't lust someone, you can't love them. So what really is the value of love? It's just a bunch of chemicals formed after lower-level animalistic instincts. After you spend time with someone you will probably fall in ""love"" with them, I mean what else are you gonna do, punch them in the nose while watching a movie together, or hug? Love is just a bunch of chemicals that happen after you choose someone or someone chose you due to lust. There is nothing valuable or noble about love. So the people who say fucking escorts is ""not the same"" as fucking a girl who ""loves"" you don't make any sense. The girl ""loves"" you because she lusted you. She lusted you because of the body you were born with. Girlfriends/wives are either using you as a boytoy, to gain social status, or to enslave you as a beta provider. So there is no difference between an escort and a girlfriend. You pay for it one way or another; the currency could be cash, or muscle. If anything, people are more likely to work hard for their money rather than their body/physical attractiveness, so it is more noble to fuck escorts. An escort just wants your money, and a girlfriend only chose you due to lust, and, after spending time with you, naturally, had some chemicals kick in to make her more attached to you, but this is not any more valuable or noble than an escort's love for your money. LOL at all the blue pillers who think their gf/wife ""loves"" them. Absolute tools.
Ex4: Across the numerous media platforms that women infest to plug their egos into the artificial happy-juice pump, there seems to be a trend of virtue signalling and yearning for companionship via the domestic pet, often dogs in this context.  'I want to be the person my dog thinks I am.'  'Proud dog mom!'  'I just want love from someone like I get from my dog.'  O_o  What can we learn from this?  She loves her pet more unconditionally than she will ever love a human, especially a male (you shitlord).  Yeah sure, she will fuck you here and there, but make no mistake about it, she will never love you more than her animals, especially If she doesnt have children because: (drumroll, drumroll, drumroll....)  Women love children -&gt; children love puppies, and when there is no cuckspawn to love, animals are the next best option.  A woman can watch the news and hear about five people being decapitated with a dull chainsaw and not bat an eye, but the second it cuts to commercials and an ASPCA/Humane Society ad comes on, she flips the fuck out.  Gents please take note, forgetting the name of her poofy poodle or her precious little tibby-tat is on par with, or perhaps even worse, than calling her another woman's name while you're fucking her.  The quotes above in this post provide a clear picture that any effort you would make to 'love her the way her dog does' would be an exercise in futility of negotiation and inequitable comparison.  These women are so deeply invested in their animals that they are literally the Chads in their life.  This is even more true with horse-loving chicks.  They are all crazy bitches wearing chastity device-shaped beta sunglasses that fuel her hamster wheel with premium pellets from Petsmart to make her somehow believe that any man around her could never possibly usurp the alpha status of her stallion-in-crime (which she probably fucks in the stable from time to time.)  As Roosh once said, the hypergamous post-wall slag that somehow fails to never reproduce, or even get to single momma status, will use a domestic pet as a surrogate offspring.  The many nights she spends continuously without beta male attention/resources or being denied of Chads superior cumload, the more she realizes her lonely fate and tries desperately to treat her pups like they were her own children that she know she will never have.  Too bad they have a much shorter life expectancy.  Ha!

Ex1: If you've swallowed TRP, then you know how important it is to get your ass in the gym and lift. Assuming this is what you've been doing, you've probably noticed the wide range of women prancing around in skin tight leggings who put their bodies on display for all the hungry men in the room to stare at.  The gym is also a great place to see the effects of hypergamy in action. Have you ever noticed that if a woman so much as picks up a set of 2.5-pound dumb bells or goes for a walk on the treadmill, suddenly her standards for fitness in a male mate skyrocket to the stratosphere?  After hitting the gym and mostly chatting for 30 minutes to an hour, three times a week, and surviving on a diet consisting mostly of sugary Starbucks drinks, cheese fries and alcohol, she now feels entitled to a 6'+ 200+ pound male with 6% body fat who bench presses 350 pounds, and she is unlikely to entertain a suitor who doesn't meet these ridiculous expectations (unless of course your game is air-tight and you can deal with her shit-tests/maintain frame.)  The gym might seem a great place to meet women but because the effects of unrestrained hypergamy are in full swing in this sort of environment, you had better be the fittest, leanest, strongest guy in the room if you expect to dominate the competition.  You might think that the fact that you're in much better shape than her will automatically make you good enough, but that just isn't the reality. Similarly, you might think because your lame office jobs pays you more than that cute waitress, you automatically make enough money to impress her, but that just isn't the case. That waitress still sees herself as worthy of a 6-figure earner, and that girl in the leggings with the big ass doing cable kick-backs and unweighted squats still sees herself as worthy of Adonis himself.  It's the same with wit, charm, popularity (social proof), facial structure, etc. Women feel entitled to men who are vastly superior to themselves in at least some attributes.  As men we need to find an area that sets ourselves apart from the competition. A niche where we can be the alpha and occupy the top of a dominance hierarchy. If looks are going to be your niche, you had better have the facial structure of a male model. If career success is going to be your niche, you had better be out-earning 99% of the people in your field.  If fitness is going to be your niche, you had better have the body of a Greek god, and you should probably consider taking steroids because your competition is willing to do what it takes to beat you, even if you're not. That guy at the gym who's obviously on roids? Most women are too stupid to know that. They just think he works harder than you.  The niches I've just mentioned have a LOT of competition, so you had better be willing to do what it takes to win if you want to be competitive. If not, you need to find a niche that isn't occupied by so many people. Find your own brand of alpha; be the salty pirate king or the Italian kitchen emperor. Find what works for you. Find the niche that's suited to your unique talents and dominate it.  I'm not saying you should give up lifting; by all means, continue, but maybe re-consider those flexing shirtless Tinder photos if your physique isn't God-like, because if fitness is going to be your brand of alpha, get in line because the competition is fierce and she's already swiped left on two dozen guys with similar photos by the time she looks at yours.
Ex2: **Summary**  Leave the chit chat for social gatherings. Places like your local watering hole. *NOT* the gym.    **Body**  Just minding my own business moving weights at my clubhouse gym, listening to heavy metal. Why I specifically mention clubhouse gym is to be explained later.   There's this HB6 chick, let's call her Asian, doing some core workouts. This dude, let's call him Glasses (I think his glasses look wonky), comes in and he realises Asian is at the gym as well.    The first thing he does wasn't setting up his first exercise. He goes up to her and states  &gt;Hey, I haven't seen you at the gym the past week.   They seem to know eachother prior this gym session. Honestly, he probably only comes to 'gym', because Asian gyms here as well. Mind you, sure you can nod and say hi to your pals or gals at the gym when you enter. But he hangs around her for a good 5 minutes before setting up his first exercise (Being triceps pull-down). Everytime he finished a half-assed set, he would go up to Asian to chit chat for 5-10 minutes before doing another set. It took him literally 25+ mins to finish 4 sets of LAT PULLDOWNS. Bro.    Because it's a random clubhouse gym, it's fucking small with minimal machines. Therefore, they were always no more than a 5+ meters radius from me. After a set, I switched off my music for a second to hear what kind of conversation Glasses was trying to chat up with Asian. Surprise surprise. He was complaining about his day at his work.    **Lessons learned**  * Your time is priceless. Aim to maximise the amount of weights moved within the least possible amount of time * Save your chitchat/game at your local watering hole. Not the gym * Never complain to a woman   Td;lr Don't be Glasses  Edit: Formatting
Ex3: I have been lifting for well over 3 decades and maintain a strong physique even at  almost 50.  I have tried almost everything but now find that very heavy compound lifts are tough on my joints.  I lift every other day, but focus on a bit lighter weight, higher reps, perfect form and variations in speed of movement.   The exercise I find to be the most effective and challenging is the farmer's walk.  Farmer's Walks work the entire body, but particularly the muscles of the forearms, the traps and the calves. However, the core and the back are also engaged.  One can opt for very heavy weights for short distances or lighter weights for longer trips. One can also vary walking speed to stress the body in different ways. I have used specialized equipment for heavier walks and dumbbells for lighter ones.  Yesterday I filled two 5 gallon buckets with rocks, probably about 80-90lbs in each bucket and walked up and down my steep driveway, sitting them down only to catch my breath. After about 25 minutes I was exhausted.   Some of my buddies employ them as augmentations of pre-existing workouts, but I do them once or twice a week for about 30 minutes as my sole workout for the day, using the aforementioned variations.   They really change your body and you will finally be able to bring in all the groceries in one trip.

Ex1: I'm a 16 year old guy in high school in America. Today my mother yelled at my dad for not finding the time to talk to her parents. My dad is an introverted, passive guy as he was raised in a female dominated household. Things went shitty and she threw a fucking toaster at my dad and it hit his face. I intervened and yelled at her (big mistake. should have minded my own business).   She grabs me and started repeatedly slapping the shit out of me. She's 5'7 and I'm 6'2, and a lot stronger than her. I have been reading TRP for almost 6 months and knew better than to hit a woman no matter how batshit crazy she is. I pushed her away to defend myself (another mistake?). She trips and falls down. She now says that my dad and I abused and her and will call the cops on us. My beta dad will not get a divorce because it is taboo in our culture, or is probably ""in love with her"" or whatever I don't know. Fortunately, she did not call the cops, but this is not the first time this has happened.  How do I respond if the cops show up the next time? My dad does not understand that the justice system is in the favor of the woman and men will most often be seen as the aggressor. Things like these have completely put me off of marriage and relationships with women. I feel I'm slipping back into anger phase.
Ex2: Coming from my great state of Iowa:  ""Joe Vandusen, 45, received a letter earlier this month from the Iowa Department of Human Services notifying him that he would be required to pay child support for his estranged wife's child, even though he is not the father......Vandusen contacted the Department of Human Services' Child Support Recovery Unit to say he's not the biological father of his wife's child, and he offered to take a paternity test to prove it — but he was told it didn't matter, according to state law, he said""  DON'T GET MARRIED  Article:http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2016/03/25/man-contests-support-child-he-says-he-didnt-father/82282038/
Ex3: A quick story and a lesson.   I've already made a post about my father, who is a spineless beta, so I'll bring you up to speed. He married either a pretty good manipulator or a complete psychopath that was my mother. They had no sex beyond my birth. I mean NONE. He had a stack of pornos that was at least a foot and a half tall. He was forced to sleep on the couch in the basement. She would restrict his time spent with me. I'm pretty sure we only spent time together as a family on my birthday. Sometimes not even then.  Fast forward to  2013. She got divorced and petitioned the court to allow him 30 visits a year. 30 fucking visits. Of course she played the ""abused wife"", so she won and I now see him 2 times a month. She even wanted me to testify that he ""emotionally abused us"", exact words.  I'm pushing for more, which sends her into a rage or a sympathy fit (the crying and ""how could you do this to me?"" routine).  So here we are in 2016. In the last week alone, she's asked ""who are you trying to impress?"" when I came home with new clothes, put every obstacle possible in the way of my lifting, brought home 90% shit food when I told her to get protein and vegetables, and tried her usual ""he abused us"".  To top it off, she said ""I'm different"" when I hang out with my friends, and tried to get me to stop social interaction. She has none herself and it's probably the crab in the bucket mentality. I just told her to fuck off and then did my thing.   What can be learned from this? AWALT. Get a tattoo of it if you have to. I don't care if it's your own mother(Ive seen shit tons of females pull something similar), ALL FUCKING WOMEN ARE LIKE THAT. They'll try to drag you down and make you a beta. The best thing to do is just remove yourself and cut contact (which I've been doing for the past 4 or 5 years. I plan to move out at 18). They'll cry and scream, but you won't be a part of it. Don't give them validation.    If you have any tips besides telling her to fuck off, I'd be glad to hear them.
Ex4: I see the advice around here a lot about never get married. That's great advice. But then I see people saying they want to have children. Sorry guys, but this is not in your cards.  Never get married. Everyone knows the problem there. Women are 70% likely to divorce you and take half your net worth with them, and force you to give them free shit for a few years afterward. This is bad.  But if you have a kid with a woman, even if you don't get married, you're in a far worse spot than that. If you fail to make child support payments, you **go to prison.** Let that sink in for a bit fellows.  If you have a child with a woman, you are her indentured servant. Not for 7 years. For 18 years. Oh wait, unless your precious love child decides to go to college.  Did you know that when your child reaches the Age of Majority (usually 18), if you want to stop making child support payments, you have to go to court to ask the judge to kindly let you stop making payments? And the judge can say no. You can end up paying child support for many more years. I am not sure if there really is a cut-off, though practically it's usually 22-24.  So your love child is a bare minimum 18-year indentured servitude, with another 4-??? years depending on the whims of a judge when you decide you want to stop paying.  NEVER. EVER. HAVE. CHILDREN.
Ex5: I am the product of two incredibly strong male role models. I am also a formerly obese man who was an incel for roughly five years of my life. Someone looking at my example might think that those men failed me somehow, or that I was just a born loser. Neither of those things are true. The truth is that the world we live in now has changed, and I applied lessons that no longer have any validity while ignoring others that did because I grew up safe and sheltered from the harsher truths.  My grandfather was a WW2 navy pilot in the Pacific Theater. He married a beautiful woman and lived with her for 50+ years before his death. His daughter, my mother, married a young government man at age 18 and they are still together today. In theory, this foundation should have meant that I too would have a healthy marriage and a stable family. That was definitely not the case. Looking at my father and grandfather as behavioral examples, I dated women from 18 to 25 looking for a lifetime companion. I wanted someone who would be a great mother and a faithful wife. The women in my family are educated and outspoken, so I had no illusions about wanting some kind of demure housewife.  As you guys have probably predicted, this pursuit went HORRIBLY. I got laid a lot in college, but none of those ""relationships"" turned into anything. The few times I found women I loved turned into twisted episodes of oneitis that left me shaken and disturbed. When they were done playing with me and moved on to other guys, I couldn't understand what went wrong. I was trying my hardest to be kind and understanding, chivalrous, and generous. I was patterning myself after men that I saw as above reproach. What was wrong?  The elders on this forum all know why I failed. I failed because those two men are from another world than me. They're from a world before hypergamy, before the axiom of AF/BB. Expecting my life to proceed along the same lines as theirs was a miscalculation on my part, not theirs. I did not adopt the techniques that successful men around me were using because I thought they were ""assholes."" I didn't understand the psychology of the modern women because I thought it was ""sexist"". I did everything I could to ignore the impotence of my approach until eventually the sex dried up and I became a fat beta, orbiting a few women that I still imagined would be great wife material (ha ha). That would have been the story of my life: ""Fat guy does nothing. News at 11."" And all because I held onto outdated social constructs that made me feel good about myself.  So now I have TRP to thank for filling in what my father and grandfather could never have known to teach me. The other reason I posted this, though, is to say that there is still plenty to learn from your elders. My father and grandfather ALWAYS kept frame. When life was tough, they never let their wife or kids know. They didn't suffer insult, but they weren't fucking dicks always looking for a fight. They were cool guys, and strong men. They just weren't what I needed to be to survive in todays world. Let's make sure that when we look to the past we are carrying forward those traits which made those old guys so fucking cool, but don't forget that this isn't 1944, it's not 1978, it's now. You will adapt, or you will die fat and alone. I'm not saying this to be cruel (quite the opposite). I hope I can reach that one ""nice guy"" who hasn't heard this yet and let him know he can still be a great man, but being a nice man won't cut it anymore.

Ex1: [**Full article here**](http://roguehealthandfitness.com/principles-of-rogue-health/), I recommend checking it out. I bought this guy's book ""Muscle Up"" the other day, he's great and so is his site - [**I discovered him through Twitter.**](https://twitter.com/Mangan150) He definitely sets himself apart from all the other fitness guys out there because he's not on that bro science bullshit, but actually reads a lot of studies and is very studious in his intellectual rigour. Got a lot of respect for this guy, definitely recommend you check out this article and then the wider blog as a whole. His supplement buying guide is also pretty awesome.  **Taken from the linked article:**  1. Maintenance of a lean body mass with a relatively low level of body fat is important both for health and for slowing aging. Fat tissue is not neutral, but produces inflammatory cytokines that lead to overall, generalized inflammation, which is bad.  2. While having too much fat is bad, having too little muscle may be worse. This can be seen in the fact that waist circumference is a much more accurate indicator of health than body mass index. Muscle is a highly metabolically active tissue, and contributes to glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity.  3. We all lose muscle as we age, and most people do nothing about it. Lost muscle, if taken far enough, leads to sarcopenia, frailty, and loss of independent living in old age. Increase and maintenance of muscle mass is one of the most important health interventions around.  4. Insulin sensitivity is important for health and aging. A decrease in insulin sensitivity (an increase in insulin resistance) is often seen in aging, and is the main feature of type 2 diabetes. But it doesn’t have to be this way, and attention to diet and exercise can maintain youthful levels of insulin sensitivity.  5. Weightlifting, also known as strength training and resistance training, is the best form of exercise for staying lean, maintaining and growing muscle, combating the frailty of aging, and maintaining good insulin sensitivity.  6. High intensity training (HIT), is a very effective form of exercise and can be used as an adjunct or, for some, a replacement to weightlifting.  7. Aerobic exercise, that is exercises such as running, walking, or the use of cardio machines in the gym, have health benefits, but as such they come in a distant second to weightlifting and HIT. They are very ineffective for fat loss, mainly because they don’t build muscle and may in fact accelerate its loss. Distance running can actually be harmful, leading to joint injuries that sometimes necessitate surgery, and heart problems.  8. You can’t outrun a bad diet. Weightlifting and HIT are the only exercises that have been shown to have a material effect on fat loss, but even here, if fat loss is the goal, attention must be paid to diet. It’s extremely easy to eat more than enough calories than you exercise away. “Burning” calories through exercise is close to nonsensical. Hunger always wins.  9. If hunger always wins, then to lose fat one must choose a way of eating that dampens hunger. Low-carbohydrate diets, especially those that forbid sugar and refined carbohydrates like flour, are the best for controlling hunger.  10. The cholesterol hypothesis of heart disease is nonsense. Statins have tiny effects on mortality with the potential of large, deleterious side effects.  The other 10 principles can be found here: **http://roguehealthandfitness.com/principles-of-rogue-health/**
Ex2: **Women are a Lagging Indicator**  So here’s the deal.  Life is about The Journey.  You can go read about the “Hero’s Journey” in Joseph Campbell’s work, or in Michael Moorcock’s, or even Mark Twain’s, like in “Huckleberry Finn” where on their way to freedom, Huck and Jim are really already free.    This is why TRP tells you to Lift.  So you can be in the best physical condition FOR YOU.  Because being a fat slob is no fun, just ask any fat slob.  It sux, and, secondarily, it keeps you from getting girls, too.  Look, I can tell you I’m a successful guy, which I am, or that I bang 21-22 y.o. women, which I do.  I can share all the knowledge I have, and hope you **LURN** from it.  I’m not running a religion and your faith is NOT required, but if you only believe ONE THING I ever say, believe this: **If you don’t have your health, you don’t have SHIT.**  So Lift, run, do yoga, swim (I recommend this, because when you are old you can still swim), eat clean do whatever the fuck you need to do to be healthy.  Because without it, you’re nothing.    What is the best exercise for you to do?  The one you will do EVERY FUCKING DAY.  Ask Dmitri Young.  He was a ~~professional athlete~~ baseball player.  MoFo weight 291 pounds...and it wasn't a good look.  It was also probably a lie.  I'd say 325.  Either way, that dude was F-A-T, FAT.  He’s 205 now, and **[looks like he should be in a Save the Children](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dc-sports-bog/wp/2014/07/28/dmitri-young-explains-his-amazing-weight-loss/)** commercial.  Srsly, he looks like 50 Cent when he lost all that weight for his role in *Things Fall Apart*.  Google it.  It’s a fucked up look.  So what about lagging indicators?  Women are a lagging indicator of success.  WHEN you are in shape, WHEN you are successful, WHEN you have made yourself excellent in one or more ways, THEN the pussy will flow.  You think I would be sliding my 49 y.o. cock in to 21 y.o. pussy if I was a fat slob with no game and nothing going on?  Not.Gonna.Happen.  Sure I look like I’m made up out of [spare dinosaur parts](http://www.bytez.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dino.jpg), but I built my life, I put in my time in the House of Iron, I became Excellent At Something (a couple of somethings) AND I have game.  That’s why you never see me here whining about being a no-pussy-getting-MFer.  Instead I’m dealing out solid advice to the young men.  That shit doesn’t just *HAPPEN*.  S’allz I’m sayin’.  Don't worry about women.  Be the Best Version of You that You Can Be.  If You Build It, They Will Come.  And they will keep coming.   
Ex3: This post is written for the purpose of defining the halo effect and my experience and observations.    ITS a real thing that people either consciesly or un-con·scious·ly project towards those with high SMV  So what is **The Halo Effect**   According to Google:   **The halo effect is a cognitive bias in which an observer's overall impression of a person, company, brand, or product influences the observer's feelings and thoughts about that entity's character or properties.**   **My experience**:Now that im looking my best im able to see things for what they really are. We live a politically  correct society but mostly everyone behaves or acts in the opposite way.people get easily offended by little  things.Forget about being right or logical or just being a good person in general(dont harm anyone tho)people only listen or do things that benefits them in some way.I seriously notice how people treat me when im well dressed vs when im not well dressed.And i have done my own little social experiment on the halo Effect and 20 times out of 10 i always come to the same conclusion.PEOPLE DONT CARE IF YOU ARE A GOOD PERSON OR NOT.To them a good looking,well dressed person is a good person and a fat guy with a great personality and good heart is only a Fat guy UNLESS ,he is famous or rich but then again his status is doing the halo Effect on him.Looks and status is what rules in 2017 dont let anyone try to convince you otherwise, if you think a great personality alone will get you the things you want in life  go ahead but its going to be really HARD as you will need society's approval some how.a 5'5 balding guy could definitely date hot women because ive seen it with my own eyes and we all have, but thats because either his game is top notch or he has good things going on for him(natural Alpha).   **Why it matters so much**:The halo Effect is basically society's aproval in a nutshell.when a women gives you the look like she  wants to fuck you without you saying a word is because you are a good looking dude or maybe she just feels slutty and wants attention,but almost everytime you get the alpha pass through either looks or status,with personality  or game you will have to prove it to them first.    **to wrap it up**:Take advantage of the halo effect to get  ahead in Shallow America,whether you have goals in  business or whatever the fuck you want to do  you are selling yourself as the product  so build a good marketing behind it  and of course match it with a good personality(i never said it dint matter)but remeber to most cats out there your outside presence will dictate the rest of the inside    Sorry for my formatting and sorry for my formatting again!!! 
Ex4:  It’s Saturday night, we’re celebrating a friends birthday party, I’m with my boys, older brother and his friends having a great time by the bar, holding court and trading war stories.   Then:  “ Fuck!! these fat bitches! The nerve! Why is she looking at me.“...    “ Is she really trying to get with me? who does she think I am?”   Proclaimed one of my brothers friends, A red pill man by many standards, 28YO in shape, working in finance with a six figure salary and a small real estate portfolio on the side.   As we looked over to the source of his contempt, we observed a scene primarily reserved for the National Geographic. A herd of what couldn’t only be described as post wall or on the verge of it, very slutty dressed hippopotamuses.  After a few minutes of furious laughter at his frustration and her attempts to open my friend. it settled in on me. This expression, as comedic as it was, actually had a lot of symbolism to it - other than the fact that fat women are not attracted to fat men - ironically   If as a human being, I cannot even do the bare minimum to take care of my body, why should anyone be attracted to me ? what have I done to attract that beautiful girl who works out everyday and plans her meals ?   See, he was frustrated because he has worked hard to improve himself, to shape himself into the masculine man and being approached by a woman who could not even control what she put into her mouth, thinking that she was worthy of him, was taken as an insult.   As women are insulted by the advances of beta males, so are men ( * who know what they deserve ) by fat women   Society has taught us to “ accept people as they are” and to be “ just be yourself “. This as I have come to learn from this community, is self destructive at best.   Lesson: Work hard and know what you deserve, and if anyone offers you less, don’t be afraid to tell them to fuck off

Ex1: **Husband hasn't been showing interest in wife sexually so she cheats on him with a co-worker.**   *(OP: https://archive.is/k0Tj9)*  **Two take-aways from this:**  1 - You must always keep your women satisfied sexually. It is your primary job in a relationship. If you do not she will look elsewhere. If you can't maintain sexual interest then you are with the wrong person.   2 - The guy blames himself and wants to work through this *incident*. In my book, once she cheats it is over. The trust is not there and will never return. She doesn't respect him, end of story; move on. The circle-jerk of comments is cringe-worthy.   Side note: They were swingers for a while, despite OP admittedly being a ""jealous"" guy. Now going to counseling, where her actions will be justified and he will be apologizing for her cheating.   *I want to tell this guy to walk away with the lesson but that marriage sub is so BP, it's not worth the time.* 
Ex2: I just got back from making my most expensive mistake in quite some time. I've lived in Germany for almost 4 years (American) and I'll be moving back to the States when I graduate later this year. During my stay here I dated a Polish girl for a while: didn't last very long, but she was a nice girl (and willing to experiment in bed) and I didn't have anything bad to say about her. Until last night.  A few weeks ago she heard I was movnig back to the States and asked me to come visit her before I did. Obviously by visit I thought she meant ""hook up"" so I threw a few jokes in about her old squeaky bed just to make sure that was what she meant; she never corrected me. So I bought my ticket and arrived yesterday night and she immediately asks me if I can stay at a hostel because her mom is divorcing her dad for cheating on her (again). I told her I didn't come here to stay in a hostel and she offers me the couch, to which I say I didn't come to sleep on the couch either. Then she drops the bomb: she's had a boyfriend this whole time and never thought to mention it. So I left her place, bought the first bus ticket back to Germany, and deleted all her info.  TL;DR Ex invites me to visit her without mentioning she's got a boyfriend. AWALT
Ex3: What to do if you find out your SO is cheating on you:  1. Keep calm. The worst thing you can do is have a violent reaction.   2. Break up with her. Cheaters aren't worth having around.   3. Her tears are crocodile tears, useful in manipulating you to take her back and forgive her for cheating. Don't be a sucker, don't take her back.   4. If you have to confront her, like when you are breaking up, do it in a public place where you have witnesses. Upset, she will claim you got abusive with her, and when you have witnesses around her case becomes flimsy.  5. Be unforgiving. Once a cheater always a cheater.   6. Don't blame this on yourself. She will claim you didn't give her enough attention, that you drove her to do this. She won't accept responsibility for her actions. See through this.  7. Cut off all communication with her. Make a clean break.   8. If you are worried about violence or retaliation voice your concerns to the police. Having a log of you coming to them may just save your life if she reports you for domestic violence.   9. ""It was one time"" ""It didn't mean anything"" ""I was drunk"" ""You are the only one I care about"" ""It never happened"", these are just some of the excuses you may encounter. They are bullshit.   10. Before you break up, get all your valuables from her place and pack up all her things that are at your place. Don't give her an excuse to initiate contact with you.  Conclusion: Breakups suck, but sometimes they are necessary. Stay away from cheaters, they will hurt you. Be smart in the breakup, be prepared to leave her and don't give her any ability to charge you with domestic abuse.
Ex4: I was asked for a flashback of this old gem.  If you came to TRP to have your hand held and balls rubbed with feel-good platitudes then you will hate it.   What is a feel good platitude?   *We are all gonna make it bro! Just shout out macho talk like lift and lead, and it will magically happen!*  TRP is a collection of experiences and observations that work. It's not a place to talk about things you *aren't* doing to get an emotional high.  So what should TRP be? *Its the unfiltered god honest truthful AskJeeves for pussy*......Try what you read. Or tailor to your needs. Or just observe when something you read here *happens* in your life and now you can see it.  Incidentally, the women I wrote about below are still around and their guys have no clue. They don't have any idea who they married. Like the dead people on The Sixth Sense ""They only see what they want to see.""  without further delay....     There are men who think women are wonderful, that their girl wouldn't stray, and if she did cheat then they would sense it.  These men are wrong. She won't act guilty. She won't feel bad. In her mind, she did nothing wrong.  I've been in cabs with married women (after fucking) who shush me while they call their husbands to check on kids. Heard stories from another woman about her elaborate plans for her husbands surprise birthday party while gleefully getting pounded by yours truly. These women don't hate their husbands like Hollywood tells us. They consider them ""best friends"".  What does this mean for us?  1 Do not get married  2 You can't expect fidelity from a woman, it's just your turn, act accordingly.  3 if this post makes you upset then you don't yet understand the true nature of women.

Ex1: **Be Like Mike**  When he was a child, Mike was a good athlete. He got trophies for baseball, soccer, basketball. Played in little league. He was laid back, competitive, and fun.   Then Mike went to high school and something really bad happened. Mike was tested - shit tested - by life. Life told Mike ""You can't"". He had tried out for the school's varsity basketball team and he got rejected. At that moment, Mike had a choice. **He could give up and submit to his insecurities - giving up basketball forever - or he could adopt an abundance mentality and interpret this event as positive.** Immediately after being rejected from the basketball team he stormed home, locked himself in his room, and cried. He was crushed. Trembling, he looked into the mirror and made a promise to himself that he would never let this happen again. Ever.  Mike began practicing everyday, pushing himself harder and harder. His life was basketball first, family second, school third. He became supremely focused on basketball. And day by day, he got better. And better. And better. The next year, he joined the high school varsity team and eventually became MVP.   Mike had channeled his pain into a habit. And habits - not desires, pussies, or money - are what transform individuals. **Habits give you value. The world respects habits.** Mike never gave up on  his habits, and while his peers were growing up and going through life like everyone else with a career, going out, and investing in fake realities - Mike was improving his game.   Mike ended up having a pretty good life. He went on to play ball in college, became national MVP, joined the NBA, won a gold medal in the Olympics, became scoring champion for a number of years, won several dunk contests, was 6 time NBA Champion and MVP, made a billion dollars selling sneakers, had a bunch of kids, and married a 10/10 latina.   A lot of people want to be like Mike. Learn from Mike. Build habits that will get you to where you want to go. Be consistent. The world rewards consistency and skill. Whether you're building a business, a craft, or a career.   **There's no way to AMOG the best. Money talks, shit walks. Be money. Be like Mike.**
Ex2:  In college I was a douche, typical chad as 4chan would say. It seriously works is the worst part.   In high school I was a good boy, good grades, never getting detention etc. and life was miserable.   I started college after getting out of a LTR, and was ready to have fun.  Step one get in great shape, girls don’t want to admit it but, looks are key. 2 live life like you don’t care and people will try to mimic you to fit in around you.  I was living a double life in class typical geek good grades and studying, not much social life with them but it was all about getting good grades as well as good recommendations from teachers.   When I would get out of class I had a whole different friend group that seemed to be a pussy magnet. We started our own club space and had new girls joining every week.   I would put on my persona, developed a great reputation for in the sack and had girls coming to me, it was too easy. As long as I acted the opposite of boyfriend material and kept it all businesses and sex, more always came my way.   Developed a huge network of fuck friends and would fuck 3 different girls a day, was a common experience. they would actually bring me drugs and food and drinks to my place i didn't even have to spend any money on them.   Then I started to like one, nope that's where you fuck up. Guess what, gave her the dating experience etc., and didn’t even get laid. If I had just been a dick to her, easily would have got laid.  Honestly giving the dating experience to one girl was the worst thing I could. Word got out girls stopped coming by my place etc. its all about how you’re perceived.   From there it was downhill.  I look at my single friend who just moved to Toronto and is drowning in pussy with his don’t give a fuck attitude. Im not saying that his job title and making 85k a year doesn’t help but, he could be wasting all his money on a wife, but instead is living la vida loca.  Seriously works, created a need for woman to figure out why you’re not acting like all the other guys who shower them with gifts.   Honestly make your life about you, make decisions that benefit yourself, everybody is out there for their own interests. 
Ex3: I was at a party last night with some friends from school. We are all 21/22 years old so have all gone off to university now.   One of my friends I haven't seen for a while tells me that alex is getting married to the girl he was in a relationship with when we were back at school four years ago!   This guy was a perfectly decent bloke with a lot going for him, he was smart and was set to study law at a pretty good university in the uk, she on the other hand is absolutely awful! She always shat all over him, huge strop fits if she didn't get her way, isolated him from everyone (no one had heard from him for two years and one of us gets a text out of the blue saying he's proposed to her).   He used to say what a pain in the arse he was but the story goes that he went to this university, she went with him for his freshers week to ""ensure he didn't meet any girls"" and then she someone convinced him to quit his course and move back to the same dead town we went to school in! She is not at university at all and is not very bright but she managed to grind him down to the point where he asked her to marry him, the guy is 21 years old!  Just a little example of how a relationship can completely ruin your prospects and a man infatuated with one girls pussy will be relationship mince-meat for her to chow down on.  Before the got together she also sucked off a fair few lads so add that on there as well.  Feel sorry for the guy but at the same time he has made his own bed.  Enjoy your Sunday lads
Ex4: Never underestimate the ho within high quality women mates, even when they're of higher socioeconomic status.   A few years ago I was a student at university and had to take trig. Given my past experiences with other professors, I expected this chick would be in her 50's at best. But to my pleasant surprise, first day I walk into her room I discover a hot chick in her late 30's. She looked 29.   I say hello, take my seat and within 5 minutes she begins eye fucking the hell out of me. I mean to the degree that every time I'd looked up she'd be staring. I'm a good looking guy, but I never expected a person of her caliber to flirt with me so obviously. Even others noticed. I mean I literally hadn't said anything but ""hello"". No effort whatsoever.   After a few weeks the entire class began to learn things about each other, including my professor. She would tell us that she's married with 2 kids, etc. She even showed some of us pictures of her family before class would start. Her husband looked like a short beta and had a high quality career. Over time I make her laugh, eye fuck her back, and it officially began building up.   One day, she approaches a table with me and a couple classmates going over some review and she sits right next to me. My classmate directly across from me requested help on a problem, and instead of getting up and walking around the table like anyone else would do, she stands up beside me and bends over putting her ass right next to my face. I knew that was the time to strike.  After class, I wait until everyone leaves and approach her all smooth and to the point and say ""I got time, lets go to your car"". She accepts and we go to her her family's subaru outback with tinted windows and I fuck her brains out.   I ended up passing the class lol.   Moral of the story? Don't ever think that a chick of a higher social status wouldn't fuck someone under them. Never feel intimidated by them and talk to them like you would any other chick on your level. If her husband is cucked enough, she'll find someone who isn't, even if just for a temporary affair with a guy more than 12 years younger.   If you ever have a college professor that's attractive, always keep looking up because you could very well be surprised. Always take advantage.

------------------------------

Ex1: **Summary:**  I know that we push this idea of women hitting ""the wall"" but something we don't talk about a lot is the morally self-righteous man who claims that he is so above ""sleeping around"" because he is ""mature"" now. The truth is, this guy has hit what I like to call a male wall which is different from a female wall, something I will explain in this thread.  **""Ya, I am so above getting laid, having sex, and dealing with women:**  First of all, let me say [bullshit](https://www.tetongravity.com/images/ci-images/44657/27067_the-sopranos-bullshit.gif) motherfucker. Now that I have gotten that out of the way, let me tell you why I said bullshit motherfucker.  As men with testosterone, we want to have sex. We don't need to have sex just like we don't need to have six pack abs, a fancy sports car, a nice salary, or any of that stuff but we want it. Just like that post wall woman wants the same treatment she got in her prime, a post wall man wishes he had the same success he did whenever he was younger.  Whenever a guy puts down ""sleeping around"" and looks down on guys that ""chase women"" as a means of sounding morally superior to them, the truth is that he either hit the wall or just lacks the ability to pull women.   Imagine Chad, he got so much pussy in his high school and college days whether it was due to being on a sports team or being in a certain fraternity. Due to never learning any skills relevant to dealing with people and just coasting by on his status, the real world hit Chad hard. Now Chad was clueless, why is it that the women in the big city won't get with him or care about his Greek Letters anymore? Wait, you're telling me actually has to try now? What is this shit!?  ""Oh that guy who is getting laid? He needs to grow up! There is more to life than pussy!""  We've heard it before, we've even heard it on here, and we've heard it a lot in real life. The ""grow up"" and ""be an adult"" card, post wall women play it as well as beta males but you better believe that post wall men play it as well. We can't really call them ""post wall"" men, more like ex-Chads or in some cases, they were just beta males.  The problem is, these guys just have a tough time accepting reality.  Now I will admit that some guys just legitimately don't care about sleeping around or having sex with women, but they usually keep to themselves and don't judge others. The guys that act like a moral authority or pull the ""grown up"" card on the other hard, judging the players who are getting action, they're usually the ones who I am talking about on this thread.  **Lessons learned:**  Most of the ""morally superior"" guys that play the ""grown up"" card are just angry that they no longer get laid as easily as they used to, or they never got laid that much in their lives.
Ex2: This post is expanding on a comment made by u/raisins3142  I’ve seen quite a few claims on the Red Pill over the years that extremely attractive girls (9s, and 10s) have done every degrading sexual act imaginable and are often the sluttiest. That’s not always the case.   Through my experiences with women, I believe that the sluttiest, most fucked up of them all are the 6s and 7s who are attractive enough to be Chad’s pump and dump, but not attractive enough to lock him down. Sure, Chad will take this girl home from the bar after he’s had a few drinks. She’s a good enough conquest that he won’t get ripped on by his buddies, but she’s not quite the smokeshow who he’ll keep around.   Here’s the thing: this completely fucks with a woman’s psyche. When Chad fucks her and never texts her again, the woman is basically being told, “you are not attractive enough to lock down a high value man.” After this happens, she needs to prove to herself that she *is* in fact attractive enough. So she hits the bars again and finds the next Chad, trying to confirm her own attractiveness, only to get pumped and dumped once more. It’s a vicious, repeating cycle driven by insecurity.  The 9s and 10s? They can pretty much have any guy they want wrapped around their finger, and they know it. They don’t need to go out and confirm their attractiveness by fucking some random guy. On the other hand, the 6s and 7s are getting guys with higher SMVs than themselves. These guys have options, and will continue to fuck other girls.   A few reasons why this is important: 1) That girl you have on the pedestal? She might not be a supermodel, but chances are she's been played by a guy with higher SMV than you. She has access to those guys, but she just can't keep them around. She's going to compare you to past guys in her head. Be Chad. 2) Many times, that cute looking 6-7 who you think is a ""good girl"" has had a train run through her by a scary amount of guys. It's happened to me before. Always just assume she's a slut so that you don't throw a beta-tantrum when you find out you're her 20th.  
Ex3: Far too often we hear the use of the common shaming tactics used when describing a 'real man,' or a 'real woman.'  Any time you hear this spoken in the context of intersexual dynamics, you should always question the person saying it, as it is a huge indicator of their intentions and relative SMV.  Real Men  The application of the word 'real' to a man's identity, whether used by a woman or a beta cuck, is solely valued on his utility to the opposite sex, as well as our capitalist society.  'Real' is in many forms contextual in these cases, as it is leveraged in the form of feminine interests.  - 'Real Men take women on dates and get the tab.'  - 'Real Men help with chores.'  - 'Real Men always put the child first.'  - 'Real Men won't have sex on the first date.'  - 'Real Men respect women and listen to/believe what she says.' (Includes sexual assault claims)  The above are examples that the Feminine Imperative uses to shame betas, and attempt to beta-tize the alpha, into undertaking responsibility and sacrifice for women's imperatives.  Keep in mind, to a woman, a man can be 'real' at one point, but not at another.  Example:  18 year old 6'5 Rugby star Chad doesn't treat highschool Tracy like a princess, never buys her dinner or answers her texts, fucks her roughly and blows his load in her mouth whether she's okay with it or not, and sleeps with many other girls.  Tracy loves this because he isn't like the other emasculated soy boy conforming feminists in her English class.  They aren't 'real' men like the dominant, masculine, preselected Chad.  But now Tracy is 35 and a single mom with 2 kids, none of which are Chads, and she keeps trying to reach out via facebook to reconnect and get him to commit.  However Chad is busy vacationing in Ibiza and pumping 18 year old vaginas full of cum and wants nothing to do with her.  He may stop by for a quick fuck when he gets back in town for old times sake, but will disappear afterwards.  Tracy hates this, and concludes that he is an asshole and not a real man (anymore) now that she is in her epiphany phase.  She then settles with a beta who does the 'right thing' and marries her after 2 months, absolves her of debt, and gets lights-off missionary duty sex once a month.  Her gfs and peers praise her for finding a 'real man.'  Real Women  The application of the word 'Real' to women is to artificially inflate their already low SMV to make themselves more attractive to high status men.  They may do many important things at their community book club, school, or have a PhD, but they know subconsciously this doesn't get them their desired sexually pair-bonded relationship.  - 'Real women are ambitious and educated.'  - 'Real women are strong, independent and don't need no man.'  - 'Real women know how to cook.'  - 'Real women suck dick.'  The examples above are primarily utilized by low SMV women during both their party and epiphany phases, and post wall career women who sadly have more humanitarian value to their jobs working 60 hour work weeks then they do for arousing a cock.  You will never see an Instagram post or internet meme with the above captions from a hot 22 year old, but single mothers, fat BDSM slags, and alpha widows in their 40s will do so without shame.  This is especially effective 'girl game' to ensure locking down a beta who has been sexually/relationship starved, but has no effect on Alphas because they know better and don't want women for anything other than sex.  You can't fuck a PhD, an empowering script written for 'The Talk' or 'Good conversation' from a woman who 'knows what she wants.'  Bottom line, the social leveraging of the word 'real' is a feminine interest to either modify men to their needs, or shame other women via virtue signaling to prevent competition for Chad.  Know where you stand when a woman tries to assign this label to you, or other males.
Ex4: We've all seen or heard of them at some point.  The chicks that love video games, watches football every weekend, is into kayaking, knows how to fence, knows the B-Side tracks of an independent a nu-meral fag band, loves the cult movies, or even likes to drink fucking Amstel Light...  You guessed it:  The HUGEST sluts on Earth.  Women don't have any real interests outside of the most vapid, veneer, basic bullshit.  'Muh Starbucks!  Muh snapchat!  Muh scented bath-bomb!  Muh phone!'  They all have this 'baseline' of attention outlets, consumption patterns, and things they make the slightest butt-sliver of effort to learn about.  So if you come across a woman with a unique taste in something out of the norm, you can bet the house that she had that awareness fucked into her by a Chad (s).  Women take interest in the interest(s) of the top tier cock in which they choose to ride with enthusiasm.  They are like water and take the shape of their desired containers, which is why she is attracted to men that lead and have a mission in life and don't text her 'love you babe' 6 times a day.  This is a simply part of her sexual strategy, and the more it fails in locking down Chad, the easier it will be for you to identify these red flags that are manifested in her ever-growing portfolio of unusual tastes acquired from belching up the latest Alpha's cum bubble.  Betas don't realize this, and will swoon over her unicorn-ness until she squashes their blue balls with her fucking Marilyn-Manson autographed superheels.  It's also important to note that the fact that these kinds of women have to resort to such character molding demonstrates that they weren't attractive enough in the first place to secure a high SMV man, so they have to become his shadow in hopes that her 'personality' and liking to his interests would be enough to keep him from straying and destroying the sweet sugar walls of younger, tighter pussy while she cries at home with a bucket of Ben and Jerry's while staying plugged Into the happy-juice pump (instagram) to dupe herself into believing she still has value in life.  It's one thing if she's been dreaming about becoming successful in one of these areas (i.e. sports or music) or has a long-standing interest in one of these areas/hobbies since she was a kid.  But if she's randomly ranting on about shit or knows something oddly specific about the said topic but cant speak shit to any other aspect of it, blow it in her face and plate accordingly.

------------------------------

Ex1: God, you name it. But! It all starts with one concept: The Red Pill understands that women do not respond to, and do not give a fuck about how you feel, as a man. Not only does a man showing emotional duress  disgust women, it also angers them. Especially when this duress is aimed at their relationship, or the direction of their relationship.    Go to any relationship advice forum; relationships, asks men, and outside of Reddit, almost any site related to relationship advice, they will tell you to *communicate.* The people there will tell you to do everything except ignore and self improve. They tell you to prod and pick at it. And even if they don't, what they tell you will result in your prodding at the relationship in some way.    They'll tell you, you can fix your relationship and that you should preserve what you have with your little, precious, unicorn, instead of standing up and using your inherent ability to be outcome independent and increase your abundance. Inherent? Yes, if you are alive, which I suspect you are, you have the ability to cultivate this. Here at The Red Pill, we give it to you straight. No wonder why most become upset.    Your whole life your fed a bunch of bullshit advice, and in turn your expectations become fucked up. You expect women to care, understand, and have empathy. All things they do not.     So why do women only find themselves attracted to males who, by the standard of askmen, or most relationships forums, ""treat them badly and act like assholes?"" Because those men either consciously or subconsciously understand that women do not give a single fuck about their feelings.     As a result, those men take care of themselves firstly. And that persona carries with it the idea that she will always come second. Right where she can't admit she agrees, but so badly wants to be. Paradoxical?    The ego of a woman will tell her, ""go feminism, we are equal!"" The biology of a woman will tell her, ""damn, I'm wet again."" And when millions or even billions of women can come in contact with each other (thank television for this, without it the feminist movement wouldn't have started.) you have a slew of confused hamsters, fucking up not only the way women view things, but the the way men view things.     It's simple: a guy isn't creepy, or able to act unattractive, unless he is below her. A guy wouldn't be able to have consider to rape her, unless he was below her.    And without frame, you've already set the bar much lower than you think. Without frame, respect=zero. If respect=zero, attraction is also equal to zero. Here at The Red Pill, we understand the place of a women, even when the rest of the world can't understand why, all of us know due to our great success with women as a result.      Fuck the haters and excuse the confused. Do what works, and restore the natural order to your world as a man in 2017.
Ex2: I felt like the relationship ran its course.  She was a great person, and despite her high achievements in academia (summa cum laude), she still was a very insecure person.  I did everything in my power to make her feel like she was a great person, and doing amazing things in life.  From November of 2017, up until the day she crossed the stage at University of Maryland and graduated with her Masters in Public Health, she was habitually complaining and worrying about everything.  I basically made it my duty and responsibility to try to **change** her mood. But it never worked, and rightfully so.  The day of her commencement ceremony, I woke up early, bought flowers, sat next to her family and was hoping she would be happy to see me after she crossed the stage. Seven years of dating the same woman, I was hoping I would get some type of moment of gratitude from her (Rule #6 confirmed).  Her facial expression, her body language, and her inability to show some type of affection to see me was absent.  Seven years of dating, and this was the best we could do? I did a lot of reflecting and started questioning my own ability to be a boyfriend. Days later, I felt like it was appropriate to end things with her. By her own surmise, she was surprised once she found herself on the other end up being dumped. Again, our entire relationship was based on us arguing, her threatening to end things, and me begging for forgiveness.  It was very unhealthy, and inconsiderate of each other.  Her response after I told her I no longer wanted to be in a relationship was, “It hurts, and it feels like I am losing you, and I don’t want to”, and I was shocked because she actually gave a damn.  One of the main reasons I stuck around was because I was desperate and afraid to go back out in the field. Needless to say, days after breaking up with her, I hooked up with this 20F with a hump like a camel. But sadly, I returned to my old AFC ways and would spend hours with this lady out of desperation.  I think now, I am slowly learning how to mentally remove women from my mind by continually spin plates, and what I am finding subconsciously is, I no longer have the energy or desire to talk about these so called love interest. I am only 2 months out, and Tomasi mentioned this being a process and I have to be eager but also patient.

------------------------------

Ex1: Tldr I realized I had abundance mentality and don't care if a girl leaves my life.   Today I was texting a girl and I asked what she thought of me. She said I came off as clingy. But when I thought about it, I realized that I was anything but: if she left my life today I wouldn't have a care in the world. This is because I have a full time job, go to school part time, and am communicating with other women. This was a big leap forward for me as in the past I would attach to one girl and be devastated when it didn't work out. The reason she said I was clingy was because I texted her too much and complimented her too much. All things which can be fixed. I have found an abundance of women by joining free dating sites including tinder, hinge, bumble, okcupid, JSwipe, and jdate. I also combine this with daygame on my normal routine.   Lesson learned: have an abundance of activities and women in your life and things will work out. 
Ex2: I thought I had swalloed the red pill. I thought I had cured my self of oneitis but I can't stop being a blue pill bitch. Got friendzoned by a oneitis, and the RP mindset was going great for a week, untill she started talking to me again. I could feel the BP screaming inside me, so I just walked away from her. And the thoughts started again, what if she just DOES like the new me? Deep down I knew I should't be thinking from a scarcity mind set, but I can't stop thinking about a random fucking girl who rejected me twice. Need help fully swallowing the pill, and finally defeating the beta mindset. I don't seek sympathy from this community, what I seek is help. My oneitis is best described as a quote in fight club ""she's like the scar in the top if your mouth that heals if you don't toungue it, but I can't help my self"". Recently I've been starting to hate myself for not being good enough, and on a logical level I understand these thoughts will only lead towards a shittier path but emotionally im wrecked. I wish to defeat my inner pussy once and for all. Bash me, call me beta, but know that atleast I'm over seeking sympathy. Only writing here because I won't talk to anyone outside these forums about TRP and I've recieved better advice from RPers that actual real life friend I've known for fucking years.
Ex3: I have dated many girls, and LTRed 2 of them, with each of which I was together for about 3 years. During my dating/plating/ONSing sprees I have made a lot of mistakes, like hitting on hot dumb babes and skipping decent looking smart gals.   When I was talking/texting to multiple girls at the same time, I used to put all of them in such a situation that with whichever I choose to push it further, they would be responsive. I did this to have an ease of mind and have multiple options aka Abundance Mentality. The problem is, I always chose the hottest one regardless of their intellectuality. This is a huge problem, make no mistake. As a person who identifies himself as an intellectual man, I like talking about deeper stuff more than superficial sex-related daily topics and gossips. But these HB8+ girls don't feel the need to really learn about or even be curious about smart stuff because they have pussy pass and they can get away with everything. AWALT, you might as well say.  A smart guy, be it a man or a woman, is always keen to learn new things and listen to those who are experienced. In relation to what I said previously, HBs are only interested in amplifying their looks and status and hence getting a pussy pass. Whether you are strictly sticking to ONS or looking for an LTR, empty minded ladies will make you feel empty at the end of the day. So next time you have to choose, choose the smarter one.  ADDITION: So since this post has generated a fair amount of attention, now is the time to reply to digressing and judging comments at once. Blame the digression on my incompetence at compiling coherent, story-like writings, can't apologize though since I'm not a writer by profession.   The italicized part is unrelated to the point being made here, and served the purpose of why I came up with this post; yet it generates the most controversy, so I deleted it. Nobody should care how good I am at fucking signal processing, this is not a resume and it's not a job searching site. But the HB8.5 seemed interested in talking at first since she was the one talking about tuning and frequencies; maybe I was boring, maybe AWALT, maybe if I was hot enough this would have an amplifying effect, etc. The point is, if the lady is decently hot and most importantly, more smart than hot, you will feel the most satisfied. Because if you fuck up like I perhaps did, it's more likely that you will be given another chance. Otherwise you will eventually feel drained for trying so hard to be fun and attractive. According to my experience, at least.  Lightly edited for clarity and taste.
Ex4: I’m gonna keep this short and sweet for you guys. No fluff or fanfiction-style overly descriptive sex paragraphs. Just my simple description of events and the knowledge I gained.    Back in high school I had severe oneitis for a girl (let’s call her Julia) and thought that being a nice guy™ was the way to win her heart. Obviously, it failed miserably leading to her rejecting me when I declared my love for her. We lost touch for the most part and a few years pass. In those few years I’ve gained probably 25 lbs of muscle, revamped my fashion, and have adopted TRP principles when dealing with women. All of these combined have made me a lot more attractive to them than before.   So this past spring break I was in Miami with a few friends when I get a text from Julia out of the blue. She saw my snapstory of me in Miami and it just so happens that she and her college friends have rented an Airbnb there as well. She invites me and my friends to go clubbing and crash at her house. We arrive at the Airbnb and I start flirting with a few of her friends. Not because I want to make her jealous but because why not. I could tell she was expecting me to be falling head over heels for her like back in high school but I really couldn’t care less. Yeah she’s still hot and all but I’ve fucked hotter at college.   We go out to the club, yadda yadda yadda, flirt and dance. I use TRP techniques like push/pull to make her even more interested. We all go back to the Airbnb. I scoop her off her feet once we get inside, take her into her bedroom, and we fuck. And while I’m fucking her I just start thinking to myself **“THIS is what I spent months and months agonizing over back in high school? Below-average pussy?”** Seventeen-year-old me would have creamed his pants if he’d known that a few years later I’d be fucking Julia with a fistful of her hair in my hand but all I was thinking was that it was nothing special. I think it was at this precise moment that I knew my viewpoint on women had changed for good.   I understand this is common knowledge to TRP veterans but for all the newbies out there with severe cases of oneitis listen up. Your mind is doing mental gymnastics to prove to itself that she’s “the one” or “special” when realistically there are 10’s of thousands of girls like her out there for you. TRP recommends going out and fucking other girls to deal with your oneitis because it works. Oneitis usually comes from a place of pussy scarcity so the solution is simple, increase your pussy supply by going out and fucking different women.   TL;DR: Get over your oneitis by fucking other women.   ---------------------  I understand I'm not really providing any new information with this FR but I think it's good to remind the newer guys on here of the basics sometimes. I don't claim to be an expert on TRP, and definitely I have a ways still to go. But when this happened I knew I had come a long way since my beta days in high school.

"
3,Gendered Movements,"Ex1: Every regular guy undoubtedly thinks that he dates\married a NAWALT.   Some *pill guys state that NAWALTs do not exist.   Most probably you believe or *want to believe* that ""not all women are like that"" - but how do you spot one? Is it about virginity or modest look? Does she have nimbus and wings behind the back?  How do you spot one if all women look and act the same way? - Principles and ideology.   Let's say NAWALT can kill someone like many other women do - but her reason would be different. Every woman wants to kill - but they are too stupid to finish the job  (that's why we have 9 to 1 male\female murderer gender statistics instead of 50\50 or even 1 to 9(which represents real aggressive intentions by gender) and that's why women don't serve in army).  Target usually does not matter for woman - because she kills to feel thrilling sensation of fake power. But unlike regular woman - NAWALT will pick a target - it might seem it is very little difference but it has a lot of sense and purpose behind it.   The same thing with men. Some men might kill - because it is their holy duty to protect their country and honorable people. Other ones will kill for quick cash, cash that they spend on liquor and girls.   World is simple and we all do the same things, there is no place for flying cows and square wheels  - it is wrong to expect something unusual like ""nawalt would do this and wouldn't do that - nawalt would do me a sandwich, nawalt would not leave youtube links in their post"" - principles and ideology all what really matters.    Every typical woman, faggot and mommy's boy(which basically are the same things(gender equality apologists were right lol)) - thinks everyone, literally everyone around her is wrong. She thinks that all people are fools. Fun thing that she uses that assumption as her personal proof that she - is a true perfection... Woman never explains anything, never uses logic, on contrary she always tries to prove her interlocutor that he is an idiot. You see them everyday, you might see them in hateful comments in comment section below. NAWALT, on contrary, does not always think so. She accepts mastermind, which makes her able to learn something from him and use that knowledge, when typical woman stay dumb until she dies(it does not makes her stop to cry about wage gap though, lol ).   My English is not perfect and I won't bother you with wall of text. Instead, here is critical analyse of some of human communication principles; NAWALT and **solid** points that differ her from others and how you can use it&amp;benefit from it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqvlAU72NhU.      It has no ads and alpha-beta bullshit, and if your attention is too valuable for some unknown little yt channel and you don't want to view the movie - please just skip the thread and don't bury it with down-votes.      
Ex2: The Carrot and the Stick. A simple metaphor, but one we can draw great conclusions from. If you're unaware, the premise behind it is that a carrot is attached to a stick, and the stick is placed on the back of a mule (or any animal you want). The animal can keep chasing the carrot as fast as it can, but it can't ever seem to catch it. But when the animal stops, there's the carrot, dangling right in front of its eyes. It's so close, so the animal begins to chase it again, and the cycle continues. Good visualization [here] (http://wellness101life.com/embrace-the-carrot/). How does this little metaphor play out in our society? It's the basis for most dopamine rewarding behaviors, which can quickly become addictive.  • You spend your day binge watching tv, because you believe that the show can only keep getting better and better. Once you finally have your ""carrot"" (finishing the show), you realize you've wasted 3 days of your life.   •Perhaps you're trying to quit porn addiction, because you realize you have ED at age 23, and can't get one up with a woman anymore. However, you're always brought back because you think can attain that perfect release. However, you're never quite close enough, so you keep chasing that carrot till you destroy your life.   Now of course, TRP is a sub about *sexual strategy*. So how does this metaphor play out in the SMP?  •For women, the carrot is the perfect man in their eyes. A perfect combination of AF/BB qualities, ""Alpha Bucks"" if you will. She will keep chasing that mythical creature if allowed to. Almost as if she is chasing a carrot hologram. As soon as she ""has it"", she isn't satisfied, and chases the next one. However, what she doesn't realize is that the carrot never really existed. This is the basis of hypergamy.   •For men, you may have come across here because you realized that women manipulated your old self through this tactic. No matter how hard you chased, you never got anywhere meaningful with her.  But as soon as you stopped chasing, you saw the carrot dangling right in front of you, and started hamstering away reasons why you should chase her again, and you put yourself through that cycle for years. Go on AskTRP and you'll see a lot of newbies stuck in this cycle. It's part of the process.   Now in order for you to succeed, you should aim to *flip this dilemma*. You should aim to be the carrot, and have her chase you like a mule. I believe the PUA-speak for this is *push-pull*. Now, you are the desired one, and you aim to keep her in a perennial chase. The key here is balance. If the carrot (you) appears to be clearly unattainable, she might chase for a little bit, then flitter away to someone else. If you are too easily attainable, she'll snag you, munch you up, then move on. The right balance gives her the occasional comfort and security she wants, combined with the mysteriousness and dominance that keep her chasing you. Of course the real question now is *how do I get to that point?* It's important to continuously be improving your SMV, as that's the primary factor to keep her chasing. Your behavior is important as well. If you're looking to LTR, that shouldn't mean you're her bitch now. Drop dread game every now and then (don't overdo it otherwise you're just a petty asshole), go radio silent if you're busy (I promise you it can wait), and as previously mentioned, keep raising your SMV. This will only make her more submissive to you.   That's all for now, hope you guys enjoyed this.  **Edit**: Formatting
Ex3: Right in response to some autistic fucking posts about improving intelligence to get laid. Here is some ACTUAL advice.  1) Intelligence does improve your SMV because more intelligent men get more resources/better positions of power. As you may note this can result in you looking like a BB so control your frame.  How to improve your intelligence:  When you are young you can increase your intelligence by learning, but as you get older you are limited by genetics.  Three avenues of growth:  1) Maths, yes that's right you use mathematics all the time subconsciously. For example when you are crossing the road you subconsciously calculate the vehicles speed and distance. This is why younger/distracted people get hit the most. Younger = brain not developed. Distracted = not focusing 100%  Improving maths skills stimulates your frontal cortex (behind your forehead) which is responsible for problem solving.  2) Learn a fucking language. When a multilingual person speaks subconsciously their mind is thinking in all the languages. This sounds weird but the human mind is fucking weird. When most of you mental masturbating losers put your thumb and little finger together for a wank, your brain tells your hand to open all of your hand and then another part sends stronger signals to block some of those out.  Thus, more languages makes forces your brain to increase multilateral thinking. You get better at multitasking, in layman's terms it gives you more processing power.  3) Increase knowledge (fucking read)  More knowledge means you make more associations, thus increasing your intelligence. So for example a programmer will be able to learn other STEM subjects quicker, because they are based in logical/critical thinking.  An aside for those 'suffering' with Asperger's like myself.  Your mind is your greatest asset. Our brains work differently, in terms of transmitting information, 'top to bottom' communication is more advanced that 'left to right'.   This is why we offend so many people, for example when we express empathy we compare the other persons experience to our own. We do this to express understanding, but this makes neuro-typicals upset because they want emotional validation.  Also whereas normal people think by looking at relevant information stored in their brain, we look through everything. This makes us slower, but more intelligent and this is why we have brilliant long term memory and shitty short term memory.  I hope this semi rant post helps red pillers.  PS, yes I know its a rude post but to be honest... IDGAF!  EDIT: I am seeing a lot of confusion over what intelligence actually is... I will be making a mega post on it (or more likely series). Some of the arguments are good, but most lack some knowledge. Everyone who actually gave an argument (even if I think it is flawed) got an up point.
Ex4: Essay:  https://therationalmale.com/2016/06/01/mansplaining/  Excerpt:  When we’re presented with easily digestible terms like Mansplaining, no matter how loosely defined, and it filters into the popular consciousness and lexicon so rapidly, what we’re witnessing is the ease with which the Feminine Imperative expects men to cede to it.  When a woman attempts to cow a man by saying he’s Mansplaining something to her she’s reached a point at which she prefers that man, any man, speak to her as a woman would. In base terms, she shames him for not opting to communicate as a woman would from the outset. He should know better.  The fem-splaining cover story is that men feel some ego-centric need to over-explain something to a woman. For a Blue Pill conditioned man this may even be accurate in that they hope so doing will endear himself to a “rational reasonable” woman by helping her understand a concept he’s educated on. What we’re really looking at is a struggle to control which gender-communication will take precedence. In a feminine primary social order, men’s means of communicating is offensive to women by default. The presumption is that men are being condescending to women by expecting them to communicate as men do, and especially within the political and working spheres.  As women push their way into male spaces, part of assimilating those spaces is to re-standardize how men will appropriately communicate within them. The conflict comes from the expectation on the part of men that women will respect the nature of station she’s been empowered to and be able to weather criticism and reproach as men have always done in those stations. The fallacy is the equalist belief that women will be equal agents while holding the same roles as men; the reality is what we see in the video above today.  So the solution, as always, is to remove the man, remove the masculine influence, change the language and the definitions, to remake the nature of the engagement if not the actual real-world factors that make the game or the politic or the business what it is – to silence the man by telling him to “just shut the hell up” or be tarred with the epithet of being a ‘typical man’.  The content of the communication is of less importance to women than how that communication makes them feel. We see this in no uncertain terms the more women become part of the socio-political/business spheres. When a man needs to explain the importance of content to a woman who is only qualified for her station by virtue of her being female that exchange necessarily is uncomfortable for women. Solution: complain about the delivery of the content and silence the men who would deliver it.
Ex5: We are on the loosing end here and the only bright spot is we are aware of our surroundings juuuuust enough to know that we lost.  Just what did we lose, you say?  We lost the dream that if we make the world a better place, women would give a rat's arse.    After we carved out shelter, made crops out of forests and gave our lives for safety(all in the name of family), we expected the local women folk to value the genes that perpetuate that sacrifice and desire a family with a (delta, beta - you make the call) man.  WE. LOST. THAT. WAR.  We did not apply the force required to defeat the enemy.  Beta us felt squeamish at the thought of applying force and could never bring ourselves to see women as our competition, not to mention an enemy to the dream we foolishly held dear.  And many of our kind are STILL holding that dream, that ideal dear.   I don't know how old most of your are, but the last Japanese to surrender from World War II surrendered in the early 70's.  They (the four of them) were still fighting a war that was lost nearly 30 years prior.  After you wonder how anyone can be that stupid, and then feel pity for the four men who spent the best years of their lives holding out in a foreign land away from anyone they knew, apply that same sentiment to the beta friend who fights from dawn til dusk for A woman, ANY woman, to appreciate his hard work at the call center, or at the factory, or the retail store.  Men, we lost that war.  It's time you were relieved from that duty.  For the love of mayonnaise, Sig, you are one wet, Monday morning blanket...  Here is the good news: We did not die.  We have the ability to rebuild our lives in the new world order.  We can clearly see that the dichotomy of hypergamy (ought to register that) is the new master and we can carve the new world out of that chaos.  The Red Pill is our new civil engineering plans - we can make hypergamy serve us because now we understand the nature of the enemy.  Side Bar - this may collate to the Trump phenomenon where he will either be a great president or burn it all down (which will still equate to a great president) and if he burns it all down we can rebuild.  What we cannot rebuild is a fundamentally twisted society that still functions - you have to destroy to rebuild.  Lessons learned.  TRP recognizes that we lost the ""ideal relationship"" and redesigned a way to beat the chaos -and- If you are still fighting the lost war, we pity you, but if you throw up roadblocks or question our methods, we despise you as a blue-pill puke.  Any editing will be for grammar. (or to add a flair)
Ex6: Just finished overhauling an article of mine from 2014 titled ""The Machiavellian Trifecta"". It's a deep dark triad related essay and my writing (not to mention breadth of knowledge) has improved a great deal since then, so I've given this piece the love that it deserves with this remaster.  **http://illimitablemen.com/2014/11/15/nuance-in-manipulative-style-the-machiavellian-trifecta/**  ---  **The Birth of a Machiavellian:**  Some demonstrate manipulative tendency from a young age, be it a pronounced desire to manipulate, a natural aptitude for it, or in exceptional cases, both. For the sake of classification, I characterise individuals who convey both behaviours as “naturals”.  The naturals fall into what I distinguish as two subgroups: kings and generals, with the remainder of Machiavellians designated advisers. Advisers consciously learn to become Machiavellian due to trauma or hardship, but for all intent and purpose were not naturally predisposed to Machiavellian thinking. These people are socialised Machiavellians, the Machiavellians of struggle and necessity, and it is they who make up the final archetype which completes my trifecta of theorised Machiavellian subtypes.  Like most things learned in childhood and to a lesser extent, adolescence, there is a certain intuitive competence acquired from one’s early life experiences. With all the impressionableness and raw aptitude embodied by the cognitive fluidity of youth, the ferocity of necessity clashes with the adaptiveness of trial to give rise to Machiavellian prowess.  This is a universal premise which applies to all crafts, hobbies and arts. The younger the person, the more pronounced the effect of their exposure to an idea; for the young are infinitely more malleable than the old, and unlike the old, need not deprogram and reprogram to learn; the young are tabula rasa, a clean slate. Machiavellianism is in this regard, by no means different from any other field, art or influence. The younger an individual adopts Machiavellian as a philosophy and a vocation, the more likely the art is to seem instinctual rather than abstract.  The development of Machiavellianism often coincides with the redevelopment of “the self.” In childhood, adolescence and early adulthood this process is rather simply “the development of the self.” For older folks, the formation of personality is preceded by deprogramming (unlearning previously learned behaviours and beliefs) which are then supplanted by mental models one believes conducive to their environment.  ---  I didn't share too large an excerpt here as this is a particularly long piece (get that coffee brewing!) but as usual, [**you can read the piece in its entirety here.**](http://illimitablemen.com/2014/11/15/nuance-in-manipulative-style-the-machiavellian-trifecta/)
Ex7: **Introduction**  Unless you are very, very, rare you are likely not carrying any mutant DNA.  &amp;nbsp;  **Body**  What is DNA?  DNA is the ""code"" much like software code that defines what mechanisms occur to form your physical body.  &amp;nbsp;  * The XX combination produces the **female**.  * The XY combination produces the **male**.  &amp;nbsp;  Now there are actually real life cases where unlucky people get the XXY or an XYY and that can produce some weird shit, but most of us are either XX or XY.  &amp;nbsp;  *Gender is mostly a simple matter and not related to the imagination.*  &amp;nbsp;  The code of your DNA operates in ""blocks"" which are shared between different species of animals and sometimes even plants.  Think of this as like a ""Universal Toolbox"" of DNA codes which we all share, but some might have certain DNA code blocks while others have a different combination that are actually used.  &amp;nbsp;  ***Am I Unique?***  &amp;nbsp;  Well, yes and no.  Unless you carry a truly unique ***mutation*** in your ""Universal Toolbox"" then the odds are you have DNA code blocks that can be found in other people.  You are part of a ""gene pool"" of shared DNA code blocks.  What makes you somewhat unique is that you reflect a unique ***combination*** of the options available.  It's like picking the lottery...  lot's of combinations are possible.  &amp;nbsp;  Identical Twins are a great example of how the exact same DNA combination can create two people who are genetically the same.  Nurture can allow twins to diverge over time because no life experiences are exactly the same.  The Identical Twin teaches us about how Nature vs Nurture operate.  They have even studied Identical Twins separated at birth and noticed that fifty years later they share many personal habits.  &amp;nbsp;  **Conclusion**  We are all in the same ""Universal Toolbox"" and we even share DNA code blocks (and are compatible) with plants.  Those who know about Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) understand that DNA code blocks are being spliced between animals and plants.  This proves that all life has a fundamental compatibility with each other at the level of the DNA.  Life is a tree and we all came out of the same trunk.  *True mutations are very rare.*  When someone thinks:  &amp;nbsp;  * *""Wow, this DNA is so Alpha.""*  &amp;nbsp;  Is the DNA unique or is the ***combination*** unique?  Are there really mutated DNA code blocks in the guy?  If it isn't mutation then when you create a baby with a woman you mix your DNA code blocks and create a new combination.  History shows many examples of Alpha men creating beta offspring.  Nature?  Nurture?  &amp;nbsp;

Ex1: I was in a LTR for around 2 and a half years - good looking girl, one of those bipolar alternative feminist goth girl types - from age 17 - 20.  I was fairly blue pilled at that point and she had control over me as a result - shit got fucked up with her job and I (being the cuck that I was) said that she could focus on her mental health and I’d pay the rent and bills for a while.   This went on for over 6 months with absolutely no effort put on her behalf - we both had a fairly bad weed addiction (smoking over an ounce a week) and I had to quit because I couldn’t afford it anymore - she refused to of course. I remember her having full on breakdowns when she ran out and I’d refuse to buy her more - she dropped the bong and smashed it once and was in tears screaming at herself - absolutely insane.  I was working 7 days a week - 12 hour days on average - in a kitchen with barely any cash to spend on myself or my hobbies and this obviously had a terrible affect on my mood - I was fucking depressed, suicidal even - I honestly don’t know how or why I stayed with her. I guess I thought that she was all I had at that point of time.  Anyway - eventually one day she decided that she wanted to end it - because ‘she didn’t want me to have to look after her and wanted to focus on herself’ - fucking cop out, she wanted to slut around and not have to deal with any responsibility and I knew it.   I was left with having to figure out how I was going to break the lease at my apartment and get everything moved out - I had to pay rent until the landlord found a suitable replacement - luckily after about a month they found someone else to move in  and everything was sorted - I got to keep the full bond for the apartment as repayment from her (LOL)  After I had sorted out everything and had reflected on the last few years I realised how much of a fucking waste it was. I went crazy - had money to spend for the first time in a long time - fucked every bitch I possibly could (within reason) - my count went from 5 to 15 in a month. I went to the city a lot did a lot of drugs went to fancy hotels with friends etc. just fucking enjoyed myself for once. Life was fucking good and in retrospect I’m so glad I took it all so well.  I blocked the bitch on all my social media accounts that I was aware of as soon as we broke up - out of sight out of mind. One day I get a message on tumblr (I don’t use it much so I forgot to block) from her asking how I’ve been etc - I respond saying good having fun blase blase. I wish I still had the messages but I deleted and blocked but she said something along the lines of: “I’ve been doing terrible, havent gotten a job and I’m finding it hard to keep going - you look like you’re doing really well though” and then she says something that I will never forget: “It’s funny that I broke up with you to focus on myself and I haven’t gotten anywher yet you’re doing so well for yourself and are so happy. It makes me want to kill myself”  This is when I realised how fucking evil they are. They want you to be sad. They want you to be unable to progress without them. If they see you doing better than them they will run back and try and fuck you up again.  I had her blocked on everything. My instagram is private so I didn’t know how she knew I was doing so well but then I realised I still had her bands instagram account on there - the bitch was spying the whole time.  TL;DR - IF YOU WANT THE BITCH BACK (DON’T) MOVE THE FUCK ON - FORGET ABOUT HER AND FUCKING ENJOY LIFE FOR ONCE. THERES A GOOD CHANCE THAT SHE’LL COME BACK AND IF SO YOU WILL FEEL EVEN BETTER WHEN YOURE ABLE TO TELL HER TO FUCK RIGHT OFF  I’ve been reading red pill for the past 6 months or so - figured it was time to share my experience :-)
Ex2: My ship is finally hitting port after sixty days of endless flight operations. I load up my backpack for the taxi ride to the hotel with two other guys from my squadron. One of them brings along another female from the ship to party with us. I'd say she's a 7 and in the Military, especially on deployments a 7 can magically turn herself into a 9. We stop by a package store and pick up a couple bottles of cheap liquor duty free and start drinking.  The night gets better as one of her friends shows up at the hotel later as well. Now this girl is easily a 5 at her best. She's one of those bottom of the ladder type of woman that gets run through every time the ship hits port. We assume she knows why she is there and we all resume festivities. I step out to take a cigarette break with the 7 (terrible habit long since quit) and I return twenty minutes later to the 5 being railed by my two buddies. They are giving each other high fives and clanking their glasses in celebration.   Everything is going well, 5 is getting railed by my two friends while I'm hooking up with 7. The two females returned back to the ship the next day and we continued the rest of our time getting shit faced.  We muster the morning our port visit ends and immediately we get called aside by our Commanding Officer. Turned out the 5 claimed sexual assault from my two friends despite the fact it was fully consensual. We all got brought into the NCIS office and separately got interrogated about the events that evening. We got put on temporary duty while the investigation got sorted out. I was forced to be the command trash coordinator like some janitor despite being an E5 and my two buddies were relegated to cleaning tables in the galley.   Now this is where the story gets fucked. The 5 claims that my two buddies forced themselves onto her because she was intoxicated. Now this girl had max two drinks and was gobbling down cock like it owed her money. She was even the one who initiated it!  A month goes by and we are still doing shit duty with nothing to come of it when all the sudden we get called to the the department heads office. The 5 had apparently told the 7 what really happened and the 7 came forward as witness to her testimony. NCIS dropped the case against us and the girl was moved to a different ship without any consequences.   My command banned me from going out in port with my two friends unofficially by putting us in seperate duty sections. Thus not allowing us to coordinate port time together. I guess it's okay to be a liar as long as you're a female right? End report.   
Ex3: This is a proper study dome by General Social Survey (GSS) that covers a few decades and not the usual broscience with whack methodology study numbers that usually get thrown around as ""proof"".  Study: [https://ifstudies.org/blog/male\-sexlessness\-is\-rising\-but\-not\-for\-the\-reasons\-incels\-claim](https://ifstudies.org/blog/male-sexlessness-is-rising-but-not-for-the-reasons-incels-claim)  Salient : ***""the top 20\% most promiscuous men account for about 60\% of male sexual partnerings""***  This essentially means that in a sample of 100 men and 100 women during a given year, 14 men have no sex and no women, 66 men grab 0.56 women each on average, and the last 20 men monopolize 55 of the 92 sexually active women for 2.76 partners each on average.  Check out the twitter of one of the authors for a more accurate graph: [https://twitter.com/lymanstoneky/status/992232558774620161](https://twitter.com/lymanstoneky/status/992232558774620161)  \^He also gets all defensive in a hilarious manner from all the backlash.   Also noteworthy is that **only 8\% of women were sexless in 2016 while 14\% of men were**. LOL.  If you didn't believe Chad theory before, you can now; also more proof for the teachings of red pill.  One more very interesting observation that the article conveniently doesn't talk about to remain as politically correct as possible is the sexlessness within marriage rates, *as observed from the graph*:  **In 2016, 0\% of women were sexless in their marriage but 2\% of men were sexless in their marriage in the past year.**  Last time I checked every married woman had a husband. How the fuck is this statistic possible ? Oh yeah.... those poor bastards. **I.e 2\% of marriages the husband is denied sex for an entire year while the wife cheats at least once**, but probably more than once.  Keep in mind, while the study is anonymous and taken in private, at least a mild form of the usual inflation rules apply; aka women under report and men over report.

Ex1: TLDR: Blue Pill thinking made me subconsciously misogynistic, digesting the Red Pill and understanding AWALT made me love women again  One of the biggest lies I was sold by feminism growing up was that women are equal to men and the average woman thinks like the average man.  This problem was compounded by the fact that my primary female role model - my mother - is a very logical and rational woman most of the time.  Once I got into my first LTR I eventually realized that years of expecting her to think and act like a man were fruitless, and only leading to endless arguments.  I got to the point where I was *blaming* her for her actions and mentality on ""being a woman"", which is misogynistic in the truest sense of the word.   I find it ironic that our feminist and Blue Pill critics call Red Pillers misogynists, because misogyny was the only way that I was able to rationalize how all women act (AWALT) in my Blue Pill mind.  Once I swallowed the Red Pill and got through the anger phase, I now understand that that is just AWALT.  I don't *blame* women for AWALT anymore, nor do I think they are inferior because he nature of women is absolutely essential to the survival of our species. I accept that that's how they are and love them for it because none of us would be here otherwise.  Digesting the Red Pill was like putting on a pair of glasses and having 20/20 vision after being blind your whole life.  Lessons Learned: AWALT
Ex2: ##**Summary:** Great composer's floor plan gives insight into his red pill thinking and habits  ##**Body:**  Gustav Mahler was a great Austrian composer and conductor in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Evidence of his red pill thinking is found in biographical tidbits from Wikipedia among other places. For example: his eventual wife was very reluctant to meet him because of ""the scandals about him and every young woman who aspired to sing in opera."" Of course, after she met him she was quickly smitten.  and  The biggest strains in their marriage occurred because of, ""Mahler's requirement that their married life be organized around his creative activities.""  Anyway, I was reading about this great man and I came across a floor plan of his residence. He and his wife were in separate rooms down a long hallway as far as possible apart on opposite ends of the home. The only two rooms directly connected to the maestro's room? *The servants room and his study.*  ##**Lesson Learned:** Your mission is most important. Others are then eager to hop aboard and at your discretion may provide additional richness to your life.

Ex1: **SUMMARY**  Women will tell you there is no chemistry. Or there is no click. But that's not the case. It's lust. You just didn't give them the *tingles*.  **BODY**  There is a lie often told to men after a date or before a date that sugarcoats real intentions and reactions. It's called there's ""No chemistry"" or we didn't ""click.""  But that's a lie. There is no such thing as chemistry or clicking. It's called lust. She didn't lust after you. It's that simple.  In TRP, we call that the *tingles*. Women want to call it chemistry or clicking. But it is all the same. It is the start of any relationship or hookup or interaction between a man and a woman. You approach her because you lust after her. She will go out with you and sleep with you because she lusts what you can give her.  To call it chemistry or clicking is nice. It puts a little bow on it. Women will wrap this up for you and hand it to you with a smile. It makes everything sound like it's a mental state rather than a physical state. You may come away thinking, ""Oh well I liked Star Wars and she liked Star Trek, so I guess that's it.""  No. You didn't give her the *tingles.* You didn't get the fluids in that vagina running that opens her up for more. It has nothing to do with mental. In the beginning, it is all physical.   To get more out of the lust and to get past the lust phase is why this sub exists. It requires that you work on yourself and make yourself into a man that women lust after.   Let's not sugar coat it and call a spade a spade.   Don't be a guy looking for chemistry. Be a guy looking for lust.  **tldr**  Women will say there is no chemistry or no click. But, in the end, it's not about those vague terms. It's about the fact that she does not lust after you and you failed to give her the *tingles.*
Ex2: Sounds crude but after dating many girls it's been distilled into this.  Since i've been in graduate school 10 out of 12 i've dated have been vegetarian, gluten intolerant, and or focused on feminism. I was in the fine arts, and it's much worse. I'd like to discuss what I think is happening to the younger girls/men steeping in sjw culture but right now I couldn't do it justice.  A friend of mine once told me, ""You may not want a girl who smokes cigs, but a girl who isn't cool with you smoking cigs is not a girl you want.""   Why i'm suggesting this test is because you can't always catch red flags when you're into a girl. When you show her the mad tv ""can I have yo numba?"" skit and she says ""I don't know why i'm laughing at sexual harassment but its funny"", it should be a big red flag. But you might just think, ""haha oh yeah it is, but yeah it's funny"" and move on like a normal person. But if you asked yourself, ""if she said that, would she try anal?""   Im being a bit farcical but i'm mostly serious. By giving yourself this scenario, or something similar, you should be able to assess the girl much quicker than 4 weeks down the road.   The best explanation I can currently give is that it helps you see much easier rather than waiting for the big red flags. This isn't actually about anal sex; it's about you picking up on her ability to be flexible, compromise, be open to new ideas. If at one point you mention doing something she says ""no i'm not interested in that... but I might give it a chance"" versus ""no, i'm not interested in doing that"". Ask yourself ""would she try anal?"" depending one what you've picked up from body language, conversation, etc. you should have your answer.   Many of you might not struggle with your ""picker"", but my has been jammed up for a while. Often they're single for a reason, or with a beta for a reason. With feminism on the rise all of this is likely to get much much worse. Victimized women are not strong women, they're pampered spoiled fragile women. Bye bye crude jokes because this younger generation just gets triggered. Find a girl who can laugh off the things you do she doesn't agree with. Maybe it's anal.   
Ex3: Dating apps are the new era of dating, but why?   Because sex/getting laid is one of the core needs of a human being. Companies are aware of this and set up their apps to make the maximum amount of money possible. Take Badoo for example. Companies know that hot girls get visited a lot, so what do they do? The more visitors a girl gets, the more credits you need to pay to be able to talk to her, but when you match with the girl you don't have to pay anything. But we all know that to get a HB8-10 girl to like you, you need to be at least in the top 10-20 percent. The moment the guy pays credits for the girl, he has already lost the battle, by doing that he puts the girl on a pedestal and it will be noticed in the way he talks to her. The guy expects something from the girl because he puts in some virtual credits to unlock the golden pussy. The girl on the other hand will be automatically disinterested because he doesn't have the right SMV. In the end the guy only loses money and the girl wins validation.  Conclusion:   Don't use dating sites that use credits as their main currency.  
Ex4: Hot girl i am talking to literally just said ""I don't date, i don't know how to date, men don't talk to me, i've never been asked out, i've never been approached at a bar"". She's a hb9, tall, athletic &amp; tons of fun.  Hot girl I dated for a year last year. Beautiful tall slender redhead, runner. hb8. Same thing. Never been approached. She had never even had a boyfriend except one loser in college. She used Tinder to meet dudes and had been on about 30 awful dates with unconfident and needy guys.  Beautiful girl I dated for 4 years before that. hb8 super extravert who loved to party. She's been single since we broke up. Her best option since was a guy who approached her through a mutual friend and despite having absolutely nothing in common she dated him for a while, because he was the only fucking guy who took a shot. She is lonely. She just wants someone to do things with and watch some TV and bang.  We have these ideas that hot women have high SMV and are in demand and approached all the time and have all these options. It's just not true. The only options they have are the guys oogling them on swipe apps. All of these girls hate swipe apps. They just want a man strong enough to come talk to them, and that doesn't exist anymore.
Ex5: Every date I go on, I make it an attempt to focus on ONE concept to either learn, field test, or solidify. Tonight, I verified how critical the notion of ""Always assume attraction"" is.  Met up with a HB7 via online dating app at a bar who claims she is an avid Christian and acts like she's a unicorn of family values (which admittedly intimidated me, hence the title of this post). She looked even better in person which immediately got me motivated to have a good time. Grabbed a drink at the first bar and immediately from the start, implemented calibrated kino; Resting my arm on her leg, poking her for high points in stories and jokes, playful shoulder punches, and seeing how long I could hold her hand. Got her talking a lot about herself and had good conversation. At lulls in the chat I held firm and unbothered by the silence, and waited for her to reinitiate conversation which, to my surprise, happened every time. Paid for our drinks (she bought the next round at second bar) and escorted her out.   Escorted her arm in arm to the next bar a few blocks away. Further small talk and calibrated kino escalation and I pick up on some IOIs I may have missed. When I withdrew my hands from her legs and arms she searched for them. When I bantered that I bet she can't stop smiling we stared at each others eyes and called her out for losing our ""game"". I realized that I had been talking more rapidly/pressured than I should have and slowed down my speech tremendously. At this point she became very fidgety and would not stop looking at my arms and hands. I figured that her attraction to me was at its peak, yet, only one way to find out. Easy kiss barrier was broken which transitioned to caressing, resting my hands on her inner thigh, and likewise her hands on mine.  Kiss her a few more times outside the bar while waiting for our respective ubers and she mentions how I was her first date in about a year. I don't believe it's true, nor do I give a fuck. What matters to me is that she has been a large step up from the former low value girls I was pulling as of recent. I had a great time, texted for logistics only, and realized the whole ""Christian"" thing was just a shit test. I didn't dread the thought of being rejected, nor did I feel the need to impress her like I have tried with many girls before finding TRP. Instead, I focused on myself having fun, and she was merely joining me on the sideline. Even if she does go to church every week, all girls, fat or fit, work nearly the same on the inside; They crave the companionship of high SMV males. Hence, I need to keep lifting and improving myself socially and in my studies to keep this up.   I feel on top of the world this week; Maxed my bench at 225 this morning, have a date with an HB8 tomorrow, another date with a HB7 on Thursday, and a date with the girl from [this](http://archive.is/2b9Yb) post on Friday. Sent her a brief text saying to enjoy the rest of her night after she let me know she got home safely, and she already is asking to hangout again. I can literally feel my SMV increasing from all the work I have been putting in, and for once, I am finally starting to see **myself** as the prize, rather than her.  Always assume attraction.  -RPD  Edit- Just as an update as I don't feel like making a separate FR with my HB8 tonight, ended up passing multiple shit tests, heavy resistance, and had a make out close. Hardest date yet but had great success. Thanks again for reading.

Ex1: Keep your game simple. None of this PUA beta bullshit.  I either drag a women home from the bar the same night i meet her with the ""share a taxi?"" line or i ask i women i want to fuck to come over and watch a movie. (Don't say Netflix and chill).   This is as basic as it will ever get and EVERYONE knows what it implies. If the woman says yes to sharing a taxi or watching a movie she is most certainly game to fuck. There are exceptions of course and they may change their mind but then you just cut your losses and move on.   Generally if a girl agrees to come over and watch a movie with me i have my arm around her within 5 minutes of starting the movie and move on from there.   Seriously if she agrees to come over she is interested (unless you managed to previously fuck it up by trying to be her friend).  You don't need ""game"" or the ability to read social cues or neuro linguistic programming or some shit. You simply put an offer on the table and see if she is buying.    Anytime a woman puts herself in a position where she is alone with you in her or your home it generally means she wants you to fuck her. I don't care what she says her reasons are.   I used to host a lot of parties in my house back in the day. I often got drunk and decided to sleep early. Two of those times i had women who i thought was out of my league come in to my bedroom giving me some bs excuse to sleep in my bed. ""it's too late to get a taxi and all the sofas are taken"" or whatever. I instantly knew they just wanted me to fuck them and so i did.   What i am trying to say is that you should ignore what you think her intentions are and instead look at the current situation you are in. If she put her self in that situation chances are she want's it.   
Ex2: I’m guessing I’m far from alone in this. I’m assuming many of us here were late bloomers. Late puberty. Late confidence. Late masculinity.  We never had the teenage life we were promised. Well the parties, drugs and general shenanigans were there but what our bodies craved most seemed an impossibility.  I think I heard young men entering nightclubs without Game knowledge compared to soldiers sent to battle with no bullets. I agree. Many of us simply got sick of being shot down. Unlike job interviews women don’t tend to provide helpful feedback.  I wasn’t the stereotypical nice guy that feminists like to construct. I was facially good looking, well dressed, had good career prospects, like to drink, played football and got into fights. But I never knew it was all a game. If I had the idealism would’ve disappeared and I’d have played ruthlessly.   I spent a large chunk of my young adult life avoiding women. The constant stream of painful rejections just wasn’t worth it. Then I read The Game...  Nothing has ever filled me with so much hope and excitement. I thought you either had it or you didn’t. And I didn’t. But no I was just the victim of dreadful parental advice and being a late developer. I used to beat myself up because I thought I was a loser. Now I realise I was a loser because I was so ridiculously hard on myself always beating myself up.  The Game lead me to Tony Robbins plus a whole lot of life experience culminating in reading The Rational Male last year which was as depressing as it was mind-blowing.   Now I’m thirty, well built and socially fearless. And only now do I understand the appeal of nightclubs where before they would bore the shit out of me. Speaking to women is actually enjoyable. Those cocky pricks were actually cocky for a reason. It really does feel great to have positive female attention. 
Ex3: There is an essential difference in how men see a game and how women see a game.  I remember when I was younger, and sometimes girls would join our soccer matches. For some reason the game instantly became a little different. We would all lower our standards and play it more ""safe"" so we wouldn't hurt them.  There is a great analogy there about the current state of the workplace. But I'm not going to talk about that here.  It was interesting to see how they saw the game. Differently from how men saw it.  Women were usually more interested in the relationships bewteen the players.  ""Mike just stole the ball from Zach"".  ""John just tackled me!""  And so on.  **For them the inresting part of the game wasn't the score, or a nice play. It was in the relationships between the players.**  This is a crucial difference in how men and women see a game. More importantly for us, the difference in how we see the game of a relatonship.  Men are usually more autistic. He will keep score in the relationship. He will invest and expect something in return. The harder he plays the more he gets. He will ""follow the rules"" and never ""play dirty"".  **The thing is... What most men consider playing dirty women consider just... playing.**  Shit-tests, emotional manipulation, taking sex and not giving something back feels bad for most men. They feel like they are doing something wrong if they don't clearly lay down the rules and take logical decisions.  On the other side, women like this because it essentually puts them in a position of power. When they know your real intentions they can try to reap from you what they want **whithout giving you THEIR real intention.**  This is why we so many guys trapped and emasculated in their relationships. They don't understand the ""real game"", the game of feelings that women naturally play. So they misinterpret many situations, and ""just don't get it"" their women's actions.

------------------------------

Ex1: **Introduction**  The difference between the Blue Pill and the Red Pill is Free Will.  &amp;nbsp;  **Body**  Let's review what is the Blue Pill:  &amp;nbsp;  * Emotional programming from school.  * Emotional programming from television.  * Emotional programming from your youthful peers.  * Emotional programming from your (single parent) mother.  &amp;nbsp;  The essential point is that you are being programmed by external forces from a young age and this is done emotionally and not intellectually.  You are taught the ""correct"" emotion for every situation and generally you don't think much about what might be happening below the surface of what you see.  This then translates to ideas like:  &amp;nbsp;  * Women are good.  * Women are never to be blamed.  * Women are strong and powerful.  * Women are entitled to everything without effort.  &amp;nbsp;  This picture of the Blue Pill is very **rigid** but based on emotional programming not objective reality.  &amp;nbsp;  The Red Pill then introduces the ""glitches"" that destroy the credibility of the Blue Pill brainwashing... which is best known in my opinion as a ""mythology"".  You are then thrust into a state of *cognitive dissonance*:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance  ...where the Blue Pill mythology now seems ""fake"" and you enter the ""Anger Phase"" in order to resolve this contradictory situation.  This is why the recent counter-meme of ""Fake Ideas"" was invented because if they can characterize the Red Pill type thinking as ""fake"" that creates confusion over ""which is really fake"".  The Blue Pill emotional programming is presented as ""truth"" all along and the Red Pill is the act of **exposing** that it's ""fake"" or as I prefer to say it's a ""mythology"".  So this ""It's Fake"" meme going around is a Blue Pill ""psychological operation"" designed to keep you from waking up.  They are toying with your emotions again. (no surprise)  &amp;nbsp;  * ***Free Will***  &amp;nbsp;  We finally are at the point where Free Will enters the picture.  Once the rigid emotional programming of the Blue Pill is destroyed you are in a state of being intellectually adrift.  Notice how in the Manosphere we get a huge variation in how people **react** to what they realize is the ""truth"" after they wake up.  We get people who prefer:  &amp;nbsp;  * MGTOW (independence)  * ONS (independence)  * Plate Spinning (independence)  * LTR (masculine polarity)  * Married Red Pill (masculine polarity)  &amp;nbsp;  We get this divergence because we act on our own Free Will and decide how we personally see things fitting together.  It's our ability to ""connect the dots"" outside emotional influences that makes us have Free Will.  Our ""will"" is not emotionally controlled by outside forces so it ""goes it's own way"".  &amp;nbsp;  **Conclusion**  Free Will is a byproduct of the Red Pill awakening.  Once you destroy the Blue Pill mythology (which is rigid emotional programming) it gives you the ability to think for yourself (for the first time) and that inevitably creates outcomes that match each person's inclinations.  &amp;nbsp;  * *Are we here to judge others?*  &amp;nbsp;  No.  The Red Pill is amoral.  You can be married and have a family and be the most awesome Alpha father who demonstrates top level Amused Mastery to create a family structure of masculine polarity where all your dependents are very happy being under you.  Or you just as easily decide that you want to never have kids and get a vasectomy so that you can maximize the number of sex partners without consequences.  Free Will creates **contradictory** outcomes...  and that is fine.  *The Red Pill defeats rigidity.*  &amp;nbsp;  
Ex2: TL/DR: Using Amused Mastery. The how and why.    I have a daughter. Once she crossed the age of 5, I noticed how much her sassiness had increased. Albeit the external world has, and will continue to rub off on her, it's up to me to game her correctly. This means approaching most topics with amused mastery. I am not and don't ever want to be some Gronk who can't handle my fragile little girls emotional state. She needs to be gently manipulated. She also needs to see a master at work so that she can one day find the right man who may possibly be a close model of me.    I've gotten amazing at reading body language. There are many sources out there that you can research to show you how to read people. Most of us also have an emotional intelligence built in, but some of us have a higher one than others. I suggest you take an emotional intelligence questionnaire to see what level you read people's facial expressions at, and then research some methods to help you understand more of what a person says with their face so that you can apply the correct game in every situation.    It's not always about being a dick or aloof. There is a push pull aspect that is involved in every aspect of game, especially that HB9 you walk up to in the bar. Of course there are many intricate styles of game. True masters understand women to their core enough to know what trigger to pull, and when.    If you want to get better at amused mastery, have a child. KIDDING. You can pick up some amused mastery books (child psychology, RP style.). Even if she's a 5'7, 21 year old, blonde bombshell, I treat her like she's 10. That's because most women want a man they can look up to, those from good homes with strong alpha fathers especially. They like a man that can put them in their place with subtle tactics that leave them saying to themselves, ""wow!""    So anytime a women adds **nothing to a conversation,** or adds something that makes the conversation **lack progression,** you used amused mastery. And if we break down amused mastery, we can see the inner workings of how and why to use it.     When a women has a gripe, she will call for the conversation to lack progression. When she gripes, she wants someone to listen. She is griping because she is emotional, uncomfortable, or not getting her way. And your response is what can change the conversations direction.     She is reaching out for a form of empathy. She wants this. And when you use **sarcasm in a form of understanding,** it allows her train of thought to change.     You are using amused mastery to say, ""hey doll, I get it. Been there, done that. But it's okay, see why?"" Just like a father would to his daughter. ""I'm stronger and more experienced than you, I promise you will be okay.""     Now obviously you don't actually say these things aloud. You cannot, it's insulting. So you change your speech to be slightly more disingenuous. This in turn is amusing to her. She sees the situation in a new light.   **Example:**   *You do something she doesn't like.*    *""That's not fair!""* (with a little pouting.)    **BAD RESPONSE:** *""Good, because I don't care!""*    **AMUSED MASTERY:** *""No, but if it were the fair, we'd definitely ride the Ferris wheel.""* (with a wink or cunning smile.)   Notice how quickly the conversation changes. You're now back in control.        
Ex3: I'm in a unique position of being a social retard putting in the work to social grace.  I've read up on the subject and found some interesting material on social dynamics, group talk, and empathy. I've had multiple epiphanies I want to share with you all.   **You need a filter**   If you're anything like me you like, to talk to everyone, give everyone at least a glance, and to win over everyone. It isn't possible, so choose your battles **after** you've made first contact. Decide if you want to talk to someone after you've already reached out.  **Every woman/man that doesn't ignore you  wants you in some way, just ask**    Life is too short to dance around social bushes. If a woman or man is interested in you they will reveal themselves on some level. Treat it like a dial, not a light switch. Reveal can be anything from a glance in your direction every 20 minutes to her brushing her breasts across your shoulder( yea, I'm short) and making eye contact. Once you recognize any amount of interest approach him/her and decide for yourself if the relationship is worth developing.  A leader does three things:  - assign roles, tasks, and value to relationships;  - prioritize energy and time to people;  - and gather information.   This is your new job; don't neglect it.  **Expressing anger onto people/things is futile**  - I was at the gym and a large man decided to make fun of me loudly, then got upset when I decided to ask him about it.   - A woman at the local convenient store got upset with me for not acknowledging her sexual advances.   - I got pissed at my neighbor for calling my landlord over a minor dispute.    What is the common denominator?    Nothing changed until the anger subsided!  - The woman went from yelling in the front of the store, hoping I'd give in to her shit test to giving me ""I want to fuck you"" eyes from the opposite end of the store.  - ‘Roid rage went from a studdly, popular man in the gym to crazy, unstable boy who can't seem to handle his own emotions.  - I went from nervous, unproductive mess to discussing pleasantries with the same neighbor (he now makes a point to stop and talk to me every time he catches me outside).   **Gain some emotional intelligence,  but don't use it**  I spent some time learning how to read emotions and learning good actions to alleviate them. In the process I realized that people need to feel emotions! It takes far too much energy to micromanage and ""fix"" them. Do not worry what people think/feel about you, instead use the emotions you do recognize to your advantage. The same goes for yourself as well.   tl;dr: keep it simple and be 100% genuine, let go.
Ex4: If there was one thing that has saved my ass plenty of times and has gotten me plenty of ass is that women **LOVE** Emotion. It’s like a drug to them, and Emotion should be Man’s main weapon in the war of the sexes. Emotions our are tits and ass. They even the playing field.  There is a constant complaint that women are too emotional, though this is the trait of women we should be most thankful for. Emotions are at the center of almost every significant action a woman takes. Why do Women have sex? If you say it’s because Women like to orgasm, then you are wrong. Only men are have sex for the sole reason of chasing a orgasm. Women have sex for **Validation**.   We simply need to look at a woman’s actions to see proof. Remember that one guy that sold drugs and was asshole to her all the time? What about that skinhead who was a part of a biker gang and beat the shit out of her? How about the older man who killed his first wife and burned his second wife, but is just misunderstood and was beaten by his father and he’s so confused? You know who you don’t hear about? The guy with a 9\-5 with a engineering degree who bought thousands of dollars worth of jewelry and showers her with love and affection.  Logically, we know which man would be a good choice for a woman. **But women don’t have sex based on logic**. It would be in your best interest to stay away from logic if you are trying to get a woman. One of the lessons I learned after learning the importance of Emotion is that if I’m trying to make sense of a woman’s actions, I’m in the wrong mindset. For Men, it makes sense that rich guys get pussy, therefore women like money. It’s a lot more confusing to think women only like the Emotions money can supply them with.  There are multiple directions I could take this with, and go with the familiar concepts of emotional rollercoasters and Push/Pull but I don’t want to diminish the boiled down concept.  When in doubt, always go back to giving a girl Emotion. As soon as you veer away from that, the sooner you will fuck up.

Ex1: Hey all  On April 3rd 2017 Andrew The Private Man died from a rare form of eye cancer. He was an alumni speaker of The 21 Convention, a prolific red pill blogger, and a confirmed speaker for The 21 Convention 2017.  When it became increasingly apparent he was going to die before the event, I decided to dedicate the 10 year anniversary of the event to him. He accepted the dedication in person in South Florida.  The video published today on the anniversary of his death is a panel of the speakers who knew him best at the event. All ads have been disabled on the video.  Check it out at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X5IB_c7HFI  We have additional videos of Andrew linked in the YouTube cards of this new video, as well as 1 more video from the 2017 event that focuses on Andrew.
Ex2: Been getting back into the gym recently after winning a 2 year long battle against some injuries and came across this video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71zyEOzerbw  If you're at TRP and have read into stuff, chances are, the name Dmitry Klokov rings a bell. Olympic weightlifter (2008 silver) that is now seemingly a sickunt elite weightlifting trainer. One he has a hell of a strong and proportional physique (I'd argue that sorta physique is the goal) and two, he has game. Watch any video and look at the way he can control any audience, espeically women.   Watch the first minute of the video and watch this girl he is supposed to train literally utter the words ""I felt the need to obey him because he is so big and manly""  Gym works boiz
Ex3: **Summary**: Man catches wife cheating with friend. Videos for evidence. Video is posted on a default sub-reddit and majority of comments are red-pill.  **Body**: I haven't posted on The Red Pill since way back when links were allowed, but this one is too good not to share. There's currently a video that was posted into the videos default sub-reddit of a man catching his wife in the act of cheating with one of his friends.  The man videoed the encounter presumably to be used as fuel in a divorce proceeding. The comments on the videos thread are actually quite red-pill.  You can see the video here: https://www.youtube.com/v/IcbFjLFA4Ec [NFSW: Very slight nudity]  **Lessons learned**: Collect as much evidence as you can. AWALT.  EDIT: [Including link to reddit video comments.](https://archive.is/DmoS6) TRP relevant comments begin around the third thread down.
Ex4: Tl;dr Your goals are always more important than women. Make sure you do everything you can to accomplish your mission. Your woman can either be an anchor or a booster.  Here is the video in question: [Goals over Girls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4RgAlz2pmM). A lot of you probably know Elliott, those who don't - he is known mostly for his youtube videos about fitness and vlogs.  In his recent video he responds to a viewer's question, a guy whose goal is to make career in music, but his gf is afraid that he will be financially unstable and wants him to make a diploma. The guy goes on: &gt; I wanna have both her and music, but if I'm not going to get a degree she may end up breaking up with me, because she doesn't want to struggle financially.  Now Elliott drops one of the core RP truths, telling a story from his life: &gt; So when I started dating Kelly in high school, I was already very clear about my purpose. I knew I was either going to be a professional athlete or a coach.[...] I warned her: I'm going hard. I've a mission. It's going to be a bumpy road I'm on. I'm ready for the struggle, but I'm not going to stop until I get where I'm going. I love you, but this is where I'm going. You can either come with me or not.  A lot of you probably will disagree with him, saying shit like: 'You can't say that to women, you must show it!' or that expressing your affection is a mistake. What I see instead is a man who didn't waste a second on bullshitting. He had his mission, no time wasted. By the way, he end up marrying her and they are together to this day.  Later he explains the difference between women and man and says: &gt; I recognize the feminine in my wife and I do my best to create an environment for her, so she can blossom fully. But she also, very early on, gave me room and encouraged me on my purpose, on my mission. And she has reaped the gifts.  Guys, it's your journey. It's time to realise that you're the prize. If the woman is good at being a woman, allow her to join you, but don't lose your focus. Eyes on the mission.  &gt; A lot of women try to knock men off their paths. Like you! - he refers to the music guy - You're about to get into that trap! You love her, I get it. You love her, but mission is number one for men.  Translation: dump her. If someone doesn't support your cause, don't waste time. You have one mission and one life. There is no time for people who slow you down.  I have written this for you to give you a general idea about what he is talking about. Go ahead and watch it, you won't regret. Eyes on the mission!  **Lessons learned:**  * Your mission is the most important thing in your life  * Women can join you if they want, but dont lose your focus  * Next people who don't support you, reward people who do

Ex1: Pornhub released some statistics/metrics about their website usage in 2015.

Ex2: **Summary:** While there is a gender pay gap between men and women, it is only 8%, not the 23% bantered around in the media.  **Body:**  Article from June in the EC Journal discusses the gender pay gap.  Here:  http://archive.is/W0wbf  Author debunks the myth that women earn only 77%-82% as much as men, by controlling for the factors that:  * Women work less  * Women go into lower paying professions  * Women desire flexibility, and these positions are lower paying  Adjusted gender pay gap is women earning 92% as much as men considering those factors.  Author however identifies this 8% difference as discrimination, largely related to the decreased propensity for women to be promoted to higher-earning management positions.  I thank the author for the clarification of what is known to be a false statistic.  However, regrettably he has still to take the pill himself, noting in his own words,   &gt;""Even if the 8 percent gap is closed... I don’t think that’s very satisfying.  (as a male) I do not know whether or not women truly do want the 23 percent gap to be zero percent. Furthermore, it may not even be possible to have that gap shrink to zero due to biological differences""  **Lessons learned:**  Data does not strongly favor the SJW's, even when those presenting it are on their side.
Ex3: Hey guys, i will just give you some stats to use when you debate the female role in politics. I hope the info will be useful.  Of all US men, 52 percent voted for Trump, and 41 for Clinton. Of all US women, 41 percent voted for Trump, and 54 for Clinton.   52 percent of white women voted for Trump, compared to 62 percent of white men. The difference between white women who voted for Trump and those who voted for Clinton is only 9 percent (52 vs 43 percent), a ratio of 1,2 to 1. The difference between white men who voted for Trump and those who voted for Clinton is whooping 31 percent (62 vs 31 percent), a ratio of 2 to 1.  The majority of college educated white women voted for Clinton (51 vs 44 percent), the majority of college educated white men voted for Trump (53 vs 39). One could conclude that in college, women are more easily brainwashable than men. (1)   In the 2016 election, white women who were under the guidance of men (married women) voted right. Single white women without male guidance - those who were left to their own devices and their own female nature, voted left. Unlike women though, both married and single white men voted right. (2)  Among white men, the US Republican Party holds a wide 61% to 32% advantage in leaned party identification. Among white women, about as many registered voters identify as Republican or lean toward the Republican Party (47%) as say they identify as Democrats or lean Democratic (46%).  (3)  Canada: Justin Trudeau's Liberals, who promised to import muslim refugees, led among women, while Stephen Harper's Conservatives, who want to ban the burka, led among men. (4)  Britain: Women are 40 percent of UKIP supporters, majority of Labour supporters (5)  France: Women are 44 percent of Front National voters (6)  Sweden: women are 36 percent of Swedish Democrat voters (7)  Germany: women are 37 percent of AFD voters. A majority of women support Merkel, (66 percent for), a majority of men oppose Merkel (55 percent against)  (8)  Austria: a majority of women voted for pro-immigration president, a majority of men voted for anti-immigration president. (9)  Suffrage: Suffrage coincided with immediate increases in state government expenditures and revenue and more liberal voting patterns for federal representatives.  (10)  Immigration: women are more supportive of muslim immigration than men. (11)  Big Government: women are more supportive of big government than men. (12)  Gays and ethnic minorities: women are more supportive of gays and ethnic minorities than men. (13)  Islam: Women are 75 percent of those who convert to Islam  (14)  Finally, contrary to popular myths, in terms of voting patterns, a higher proportion of male voters supported the Nazi party compared to female voters.

Ex4: **Student loan debt hit a record high of $1.5 trillion in Q1 2018 according to the US Federal Reserve’s latest data, but while it is typically associated with millennial there’s one demographic it impacts the most: women.**  ## Student Loans Hurt This Group The Most   **Student loan debt hit a record high of $1.5 trillion in Q1 2018 according to the US Federal Reserve’s latest data, but while it is typically associated with millennials there’s one demographic it impacts the most: women.** They hold nearly two-thirds ($900 billion) of student loan debt as of mid-2018 according to a report from the American Association of University Women; men hold the balance of just +$490 billion.  **Here are some more stats from the report that help explain the disparity:**  * **More women attend college:** women represent over half (56%) of enrolled college students as of fall 2016, but hold a greater amount (65%) of outstanding student loan debt. * **More women take on debt:** “41% of female undergraduates took on debt in 2015–16 compared to 35% of male undergraduates.” On average, women also “take on more debt than men at almost every degree level and type”. Lastly, “across degree levels women in college took on initial student loan balances that were about 14% greater than men’s.” * **Fewer men have student loan debt at graduation:** “71% of women have student loan debt at bachelor’s graduation compared to 66% of men”. * **African American women are the most in debt at graduation:** “Black women graduate with the most debt – at $30,400 – compared to $22,000 for white women and $19,500 for white men.”  **The difference in student loan debt between men and women is only getting worse, as it has almost doubled in the last four years:** “women now graduate with an average of $2,700 more debt than men when earning a bachelor’s degree.” Here are the consequences for women:  * **Women earn less than men after college:** Full-time working females with college degrees earn 26% less than their male peers. Additionally, “compared to white men with bachelor’s degrees, black and Hispanic women with bachelor’s degrees make 37% and 34% less (respectively) and struggle to repay their loans as a result.” * **Women take longer to repay their loans:** Due in part to earning less than men, women paid off an average of 31% of their outstanding debt between 1 and 4 years after graduation compared to 38% for men. Default rates are also higher for women than men.  **In sum, this all contributes to the perfect storm.** A greater share of women attend college than men, but they also take out more loans and borrow more money in order to do so. Upon finishing their higher education, they earn less than men and are slower to repay their loans.  **Aside from the obvious issues of gender equality, these statistics are also important to understanding the future trajectory of US economic growth.** By one analysis we’ve seen (link below), US women are the primary breadwinners in 40% of US households. The disparity in student loan debt and earnings means lower growth in household disposable income and, therefore, consumption.

Ex5: **Link to article:** https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dn.se%2Fekonomi%2Flofte-om-kvotering-star-fast%2F  **Summary:** The ""Equality minister"" says that unless at least 40% of all board members are women at the end of 2016 they are creating a quota law to force that quota.  **Body:** It seems that if you are planning on investing money on the Swedish stock-exchange, dont expect them to have the best executives possible, but expect them to have 40% women.  If this was politics I could buy the idea that they should in some way be representing of the population, but these are (mostly) private companies listed on a public stock-exchange. Im not into finance but arent the boards supposed to be responsible towards the stock-owners?  How is putting people in positions they arent qualified for going to help any one?   Note that this is also so far only a threat (""promise"") and they are ""hoping the companies will reach 40% without any laws needed"".  Sounds an awfully lot like blackmail. It doesnt specify if the 40% needs to be a total or if one company can have 100% women and other 0%.  So what is your thoughts, could ""quoting laws"" have any positive effects in any area (I mentioned politics above)?  You Americans have a lot of ""quoting"" being done to your schools (and maybe some jobs?) for ethnic minorities, do you think that is good for society as a whole?  **Lessons learned:**   * Women dont have to work as hard in life as men to be successful, you do ! * Be careful about your investments on the Stockholm stock-exchange this year
Ex6: Summary: Single women in their thirties and forties have meltdowns on Valentine’s Day. I derive a sick pleasure in watching the wounded hamster on Farcebook.  Body: Valentine’s Day…it has a way of trolling women like no other day. And now that we have the window of social media, women feel obligated to broadcast their romantic frustrations. Of particular note are single women in their thirties and forties. The “strong and independent” line usually goes out the window, and they publicly bemoan their single status to the world; or, they talk about how their child is their “special Valentine.”  What are some funny Valentine’s Day meltdowns that you are witnessing, or have witnessed?  Lesson Learned: Valentine’s Day is a double-edged sword for women. If they are married and in love (5-10%) then it is fireworks. If they are single or in a miserable relationship (90%), then it tortures them like no other day.

Ex1: This rule has been also called The Brad Pitt rule on the art of manliness website.  Here is the gist of the rule.  If you ask a girl out and she says no without giving you an option to re-schedule, move on because she is not interested.   If she says no and then suggests another time that means she still has interest and you need to come up with a new time that works for the both of you.  Think of it this way, Imagine that instead of you, David Beckham had asked this same girl out on a date, would she use an excuse with him? If Beckham asked her on a date, would she still say she was busy? Probably not. She would have dropped everything and accepted the date.   Now we know none of us is David Beckham obviously, but if a woman is truly interested in you, she will find the time to go out with you.  I've used this rule before with a lot of success in my journeys. It has saved me time from pursuing girls who are not interested. Add this to your toolbox next time you ask a girl out.   Remember: She has to re-schedule 
Ex2: My last post on TRP received a lot of love, so hopefully you guys picked up some perspective. I like to keep things direct, short, and to the point.  So. Here.  First point:  I was trying to open a potential plate, about a 6, a couple of months ago. Wasn't working out. She finally tells me that she has a ""nine date rule"" before she sleeps with a guy. I reply ""k"", and next her. No contact.  This past weekend, she sends me a message inviting me over. I teased her, asking her what happened to her nine date rule. She replies ""well, I know you're not going to try that hard, so"".  Second point:  There's this guy who exists in the same social circles I do. We'll call him ""Matt"". He's awkward. The definition of ""beta"", even though I cringe to use that word. He was friends with my ex-girlfriend, would flirt with her, tell her how horrible I was. He put that girl on a pedestal so high, it was seriously crazy. Would still listen to her cry, bring her presents, flowers, write her songs, even though he knew what she and I were doing.  Come to find out that this new girl I'm seeing (same one from my last post) has had experiences with ""Matt"" too, used to work with him. He asked her out multiple times, finally she agreed. He got all dressed up, brought her flowers and played her a song he wrote for her on his ukulele. I know. I can't make this up. Needless to say, she was speechless and the date didn't pan out the way Matt had hoped. The evil part of me can't wait until he finds out that I've been involved with both women.   In summary:   Don't make your life about women. Make your life about you and your passions, and the women will come.   Don't be afraid to next. Dear God. Just do it. She'll probably never come back, but when they do, it's just that much sweeter.  Don't be a cringey, needy, strange man. Because I will have this weird mixture of feelings towards you that will generally include feeling sorry for you and wanting to hit you.  Don't be a fucking dweeb.  -BlackWildBoar  
Ex3: On November 2, 2017, the California Supreme Court approved new state bar ethics rules which impose heightened duties on prosecutors in criminal cases.  Why is this important? Men are often the target of overzealous or unethical prosecutions, particularly at the hands of jealous or vindictive women. Prosecutors who bring fake cases can be sanctioned or disbarred under the new rules for not paying attention to exculpatory evidence.  While you might think these are common sense rules, they were not ethically codified until this month.   Among the changes, Rule 5-110 government prosecutors are now ethically required to:  not institute or initiate charges without probable cause; make sure the accused understands his rights to counsel and does not waive important pre-trial rights without full disclosure; disclose all exculpatory evidence that should be obtained through reasonable investigation; properly supervise agents and law enforcement personnel to make objective and unbiased investigations; and obtain reversal of convictions for innocent men when new evidence comes to light that demonstrates the innocence of the accused.  It is estimated that men comprise between 70-80% of arrests, criminal prosecutions and incarceration.  When men are convicted, they are often giving longer sentences than women for the same crimes.  Particularly disturbing is the high rate of male prosecution and incarceration for alleged interpersonal and “domestic violence” cases; even when women commit the same alleged crime at equal or higher rates.  Most states like California now have special domestic violence and sexual assault prosecution task forces. These task forces are created through special interest funding to prosecute and incarcerate men under the false premise that all men are predators and abusers.  Because of these misguided beliefs, prosecutors often intentionally or recklessly ignore evidence that tends to prove the innocence of the accused man or at least mitigates his involvement or culpability. This evidence could include digital evidence, text messages, emails, the history of the relationship, witness and character testimony, mental health issues and other forms of important evidence which might negate the crime or mitigate the sentence or charge for the defendant.  Under the new rules, the prosecutor must pay attention to this evidence, obtain it, and disclose it in the case.  If you are a victim of a fake DV or sexual assault case and believe the prosecutor is behaving unethically, ignoring evidence, and prosecuting your case without probable cause, you should make an official complaint to the California State Bar or your local jurisdiction’s bar licensing agency.   http://www.calbar.ca.gov/Public/Complaints-Claims/How-to-File-A-Complaint.  Failure to abide by these rules can get a prosecutor sanctioned or disbarred.  this article first appeared at http://menslaws.com/  note: while you might think these are common sense rules that should have always been on the books, they were not.  Prosecutors in California and other states enjoy absolute immunity and qualified immunity privileges which they use to cover up their bad behavior.  The new ethics rules override any immunities and privileges that a prosecutor can raise in the civil context.   
Ex4: **Summary:** We should create a list of the key literature that drives our opponents.   ---  **Body:** ""Know thy Enemy""   Feminism is based in Marxism.  Its proponents often use the techniques presented in Saul Alinsky's ""Rules for Radicals"".  It is imperative when facing our opponents that we know both their goals and their techniques.  In this spirit, I submit that we should create a list of the key ideological literature that our opponents use.    ---  **Conclusion:**  Let's start the list with ""The Communist Manifesto"" and ""Rules for Radicals"".  **Edit:**  Here is the list so far:  The Communist Manifesto, Rules for Radicals, Das Kapital, The Mass Psychology of Fascism, Ventotene Manifesto
Ex5: For some reason, there's a contingency of insufferable, condescending cunts who decide to come here and babble about ""hierarchies"" and other JP related horseshit.  They come here and spew either word salad or pretentious diatribes about how we could finally understand how right they naturally are if we just opened up to longer sentences that say nothing. The key markers are as follows:  * Focus on incoherent vocabulary rather than a cogent thesis. * The more nebulous, abstract or ethereal the idea the better.  * Does not in any way address TRP theories, even the ones it seeks to contradict. * Usually goes on and on about the abstractly discrete hierarchies and their rules.  I have absolutely no idea how these people manage to spit out so many words that say nothing. But the condescension and total meaninglessness of their drivel is the reason I'm banning it altogether.  If your idea has merit, you can present it **with respect**, and **without condescension**. Further, you can do so without including a detailed video of you literally sucking JP's dick while doing so.  We will remain a forum about sexual selection and we will continue to treat it as a free market of ideas. **But this troll does not have a home here.**  If you break this rule. Instaban. No Warnings.

Ex1: **Husband hasn't been showing interest in wife sexually so she cheats on him with a co-worker.**   *(OP: https://archive.is/k0Tj9)*  **Two take-aways from this:**  1 - You must always keep your women satisfied sexually. It is your primary job in a relationship. If you do not she will look elsewhere. If you can't maintain sexual interest then you are with the wrong person.   2 - The guy blames himself and wants to work through this *incident*. In my book, once she cheats it is over. The trust is not there and will never return. She doesn't respect him, end of story; move on. The circle-jerk of comments is cringe-worthy.   Side note: They were swingers for a while, despite OP admittedly being a ""jealous"" guy. Now going to counseling, where her actions will be justified and he will be apologizing for her cheating.   *I want to tell this guy to walk away with the lesson but that marriage sub is so BP, it's not worth the time.* 
Ex2: I just got back from making my most expensive mistake in quite some time. I've lived in Germany for almost 4 years (American) and I'll be moving back to the States when I graduate later this year. During my stay here I dated a Polish girl for a while: didn't last very long, but she was a nice girl (and willing to experiment in bed) and I didn't have anything bad to say about her. Until last night.  A few weeks ago she heard I was movnig back to the States and asked me to come visit her before I did. Obviously by visit I thought she meant ""hook up"" so I threw a few jokes in about her old squeaky bed just to make sure that was what she meant; she never corrected me. So I bought my ticket and arrived yesterday night and she immediately asks me if I can stay at a hostel because her mom is divorcing her dad for cheating on her (again). I told her I didn't come here to stay in a hostel and she offers me the couch, to which I say I didn't come to sleep on the couch either. Then she drops the bomb: she's had a boyfriend this whole time and never thought to mention it. So I left her place, bought the first bus ticket back to Germany, and deleted all her info.  TL;DR Ex invites me to visit her without mentioning she's got a boyfriend. AWALT
Ex3: What to do if you find out your SO is cheating on you:  1. Keep calm. The worst thing you can do is have a violent reaction.   2. Break up with her. Cheaters aren't worth having around.   3. Her tears are crocodile tears, useful in manipulating you to take her back and forgive her for cheating. Don't be a sucker, don't take her back.   4. If you have to confront her, like when you are breaking up, do it in a public place where you have witnesses. Upset, she will claim you got abusive with her, and when you have witnesses around her case becomes flimsy.  5. Be unforgiving. Once a cheater always a cheater.   6. Don't blame this on yourself. She will claim you didn't give her enough attention, that you drove her to do this. She won't accept responsibility for her actions. See through this.  7. Cut off all communication with her. Make a clean break.   8. If you are worried about violence or retaliation voice your concerns to the police. Having a log of you coming to them may just save your life if she reports you for domestic violence.   9. ""It was one time"" ""It didn't mean anything"" ""I was drunk"" ""You are the only one I care about"" ""It never happened"", these are just some of the excuses you may encounter. They are bullshit.   10. Before you break up, get all your valuables from her place and pack up all her things that are at your place. Don't give her an excuse to initiate contact with you.  Conclusion: Breakups suck, but sometimes they are necessary. Stay away from cheaters, they will hurt you. Be smart in the breakup, be prepared to leave her and don't give her any ability to charge you with domestic abuse.
Ex4: I was asked for a flashback of this old gem.  If you came to TRP to have your hand held and balls rubbed with feel-good platitudes then you will hate it.   What is a feel good platitude?   *We are all gonna make it bro! Just shout out macho talk like lift and lead, and it will magically happen!*  TRP is a collection of experiences and observations that work. It's not a place to talk about things you *aren't* doing to get an emotional high.  So what should TRP be? *Its the unfiltered god honest truthful AskJeeves for pussy*......Try what you read. Or tailor to your needs. Or just observe when something you read here *happens* in your life and now you can see it.  Incidentally, the women I wrote about below are still around and their guys have no clue. They don't have any idea who they married. Like the dead people on The Sixth Sense ""They only see what they want to see.""  without further delay....     There are men who think women are wonderful, that their girl wouldn't stray, and if she did cheat then they would sense it.  These men are wrong. She won't act guilty. She won't feel bad. In her mind, she did nothing wrong.  I've been in cabs with married women (after fucking) who shush me while they call their husbands to check on kids. Heard stories from another woman about her elaborate plans for her husbands surprise birthday party while gleefully getting pounded by yours truly. These women don't hate their husbands like Hollywood tells us. They consider them ""best friends"".  What does this mean for us?  1 Do not get married  2 You can't expect fidelity from a woman, it's just your turn, act accordingly.  3 if this post makes you upset then you don't yet understand the true nature of women.

------------------------------

Ex1: The whole idea is pretty much in the title.  Don't show your wealth to the girls you intend on plating. If they see you are doing well they WILL try to trap you.  This is even more serious if the girl is 25+ yo.  You will get more shit-tests, they will be more reserved sexually, more calculated and manipulative. You will get more headache than pleasure from her. She will try by all means to turn you into a BB.  If you have a nice place just fuck the girl in her house, or a friends house, or in a motel, w/e. It is not worth it.  Don't tell her your job or anything. If she asks just lie your ass off.  Guys that had to deal with desperate girls will know this by experience. **Desperate girls are crazy.** The type of crazy you seriously don't want to deal with. Not fucking worth it. Better just pay prostitutes than plating desperate girls.
Ex2: They don't know how to just be in the moment and enjoy things. They have to feel anxious that they are missing out something else. That's why they start to make happy moments unhappy by nagging, demanding, being passive aggressive etc.   It's like they don't understand the meaning of 'just chill'.  My plate has started to give me heavy hints that she likes me and wants to be more than my plate.  I've made it plenty clear that I'm not into relationships and we do other stuff like running, watching movies, dating etc other than sex and she's a good person and good friend, and I know that I don't  see her as more than that.   But she's starting to be all passive aggressive over small misunderstandings (timing etc), argumentative over buried issues, spoiling good times etc.   I've had bad relationships before where I was very cucked so I'm extremely wary of these signals and I'm so glad I didn't go down the 'I love you baby' route with this one. My younger self was a bit of a dumbass who said 'I love you' too easily.  Oh yeah. Did I mention that my *plate* is starting to hold back on sex?? Lol. Really, you think by holding back on sex I'm gonna give you committment? That would have worked for the younger, cucked me, but not for me right now. It just warns me harder to find other plates, work on myself and cool things with this one.  Edit: from comments below, it's becoming clearer to me that I'm the problem. I need to have abundance mentality and dial back down on this plate and look for more plates. There are plenty of plates out there and I should stop being hung up on one plate.  Edit: I started to apply dread and things are back on track now with me being top dog. However the lessons learnt in this thread are valuable. I can't do girlfriend stuff with my plates and expect them to not to get lead on. I gotta always my emotions, boundaries and frame in check for it to work properly.
Ex3: Seeking some advice. I went out with this... insanely hot chick for about 8 months, 5ish years ago. It was a lot of fun, but she was immature and it wasn't going anywhere, so it ended and life moved on.  I recentally broke up with my ex and guess who pops up a few days later?   After a few weeks of sexting, she comes over and we fuck and laugh and then fuck some more. We agree to keep it casual and I spank her on her way.  We message for a few weeks, her sending pics and trying to organise another meet up with busy lives and conflicting schedules. We managed it, or so i thought because she never showed. Last message I got was: ""Setting off, be there soon"". Then nothing. She didn't show, no explaination and has been ignoring me since, other than a couple of boring, short conversations.  Which is annoying, but whatever. Abundance mentality, I've got a few plates still spinning etc  I just want your thoughts on what made her her pull away and (more importantly) advice on how to lasso her back.  I've got ideas, just looking for some outside perspective/constructive criticism.
Ex4: Simple but good response I stumbled upon last night:  Hanging out with a plate and I made some half joking comment about enjoying something she viewed as very undesirable (as most people would). Anyway she gets all weird about it, saying “I like you but you’re really messing this up, don’t blow it, just stop talking.”  Old blue pill me might’ve tried to backtrack and say “I’m joking” or “yeah you’re right I shouldn’t do that.” But instead I laugh and say “you think I care if I ‘mess this up,’ what do you want me to pretend to be someone I’m not just to please you?”  She immediately started backtracking and saying “no you’re right I’m an asshole sometimes. I’m so annoying.” Then I give her some subtle signs of disinterest (e.g. turning away, talking to the bar tender, etc.) and she begins clamoring for my attention. Touching me, trying to be cute and funny, etc. Everything went back to normal and she fucked my brains out that night.  Not exactly sure what my point is other than stick to your guns. Hold frame. Show the ability to walk away. Don’t try to please her. You come first. She’ll respect that.

Ex1: [Today's exhibit is female solipsisms - which is ""the view or theory that the self is all that can be known to exist.](http://archive.is/GFZOX)  We have a poster who's brother is getting into masculine, self improvement stuff.   &gt;My brother came home from school a week before Christmas and stayed for a bit over two weeks. He goes to school in a different state, and he's in a fraternity. When I picked him up from the airport, I was asking him all about what was going on with him. He mentioned that he started doing self improvement stuff, and I asked, ""oh, what self improvement stuff?"" ""masculine stuff"" ""don't tell me it's the red pill.."" ""wow, I'm surprised you know about it.""  This is a brother who she knows ""he also has low self esteem, and bad luck with girls.""  But before she ever gets there, she spends the entire post talking about ""me, me, me"" and ""I, I, I"" and ""feelings, feelings, feelings.""   This dumb broad, recognizing the issues that her brother is facing, doesn't spend a single moment thinking about how she could possibly help a person she cares about (I assume) in a tough situation. Nope - it's all about her wants, and her feelings, and her insecurities, and her outrage, and her entire truckload of random bullshit that comes at the expense of a real person trying to be happier.  &gt;The night I found out that he was a RPer, I couldn't spend one more second with him. As soon as we got home, I just went to my room and cried. The whole time he was home, I just felt so uncomfortable around him. He went from my beloved brother, to being this horribly potentially abusive douchebag.  Gentlemen, meet the female psyche. Completely self-centered narcissistic garbage and all because her brother has a different worldview. What a selfish, entitled, spoiled brat.  If you see a woman like this, remember that they're completely incapable of independent thought - which makes them prime pump and dump targets while they're still hot. Never, ever, ever think about putting in any real time or effort to a woman who exhibits these levels of solipsism because all your efforts will be wasted. Find better women and expect better.
Ex2: I found TRP about 2 years ago during my first relationship in college.  After this breakup, I told her to get the fuck out of my place after witholding sex (also many gas lighting issues, sex wasn't worth it anymore especially with school work) I felt crushed but knew I would be fine in the long run.  It's funny because she immediately got an orbiter immediately after I dropped her.  I wasn't BP but I understood relationships as a transaction thanks to my father and talks we've had.  This isn't really my point.  I am still young (20).  I hadn't really applied, before this past year (2015), red pill principles and techniques into my life. So much to learn and apply, easier said than done.  However, I can say with the utmost confidence that TRP has changed every aspect of my life completely from school, social interactions, and my life perspective this year.  It may sound corny but I am very thankful for each member of the forum here.  Reading posts and learning from a variety of people about fitness, self esteem, motivation, social calibration, sexual strategy, and self improvement really helped direct me when I felt lost.  I understand that we all struggle sometimes and need helping hands.  This is a great place to reach out anonymously or gather multiple opinions.    The benefits of this community is extraordinary.  I am appalled by the flak this place catches for speaking cold hard facts.    This is just a quick+dirty thank you because its New Year's Eve, but I hope everyone has a better 2016 than their 2015.  
Ex3: Firstly I'd like to express my gratitude for the existence of this sub reddit. To all the contributing members offering their precious time and experience; thank you.   You've changed my life.   This will be my first post.  Prior to discovering TRP, I was as beta as beta can be. I let emotions rather than logic and constructive thought control my life. I put women on a pedestal, I struggled with my weight, I struggled with self control and self discipline etc. To be completely honest with you guys I hated myself. I was in the sick circle of depression which caused me to abuse food, drugs and myself. That further fueled the fire of my self hate.   The reason I'm writing this post is to not give you my sad story or to stroke my own ego with the story of current success thanks to TRP. I'm writing this post for those people that are in the same situation that I was not too long ago.   Depression and self hate are a cancer on the mind and body. It's a positive feedback loop that hijacks your mind and fills it with doubt, it clouds it and ultimately makes you ineffective at being an attractive and successful person. When you doubt yourself you take away the power of choice and will from yourself. A person unable to exert his will on his surroundings, or make a choice based on input and thought is in my opinion weak.   With that being stated I get to my point. The first thing you must do if you are in a place like I described is learn to love yourself. Sounds cliché but nothing quite rings as well as I'd like. Take note of the things you've accomplished, the things you can be proud of. This is your foundation and character. Focus on this instead of dwelling on your flaws and problems.   The next step is by far the most difficult. Make a decision that you must change. This is not easy. If you don't realize yourself that your actions are toxic and self destructive than you are doomed to repeat them. Once you've made that choice now use your new found positive character to force yourself to follow through on your choices.   How? Shame.   Once you start to realize that youre not happy with the way things are now and you love yourself; shame will become something you feel on a regular basis instead of self hate.   Shame that someone like me is overweight. Not I hate that I'm overweight.  Shame that I'm not utilizing my time productively at work. Not I hate how boring my job is.  Shame I dont go to the gym and maximize what I get from my body. Not I hate not having a defined body that turns heads.  Shame I waste hours of my precious time playing video games. Not I hate not having time. Etc. Shame I don't focus more on myself.  Shame I'm not keeping accurate track of the food I eat so it's mathematically fucking impossible to get fat again.  Shame... Shame...  Shame...   Shame will make you realize that youre the one to blame for your situation. Shame will drive you through the changes that need to take place.   TL;DR: If you respect yourself and love yourself then it's a fucking shame not to do better, period.     
Ex4: I recently read The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem and I thought it would be helpful to share some of the ideas here. Basically, self-esteem is defined by 2 factors:  * **Confidence in our ability to think, confidence in our ability to cope with the basic challenges of life.**  * **Confidence in our right to be successful and happy, the feeling of being worthy, deserving, entitled to assert our need and wants, achieve our values, and enjoy the fruits of our efforts.**  If you believe that the problems in your life can’t change no matter what you do and that you are not in control of your own decisions, then you have low self-esteem.   If you feel like you don’t deserve the credit people give you for your success or accomplishments, then you have low self-esteem.   While high self-esteem might not be something which our life depends on (like water and food). **Self-esteem is important for our well-being and happiness, it gives us the mental power to achieve great things and be successful in all parts of life.** Every man can increase his self-esteem by practicing:   **The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem**    **1. Living Consciously:** We are aware of what happens in our life and taking responsibility. It’s the ability to be able to stay congruent with your beliefs-values and act through them.    **2. Self-Acceptance:** Accept that you are not perfect. Nobody is born perfect, everyone has their own flaws. There is no point to start beating yourself because you are shorter than your co-worker. Instead, you must accept yourself for what you are. You might be short but the tall guy next to you might be bald and not like it either.   **3. Self-Responsibility:** It goes in hand with Self-Acceptance. It’s the continuation of that process. After you have accepted your flaws and mistakes. You now have to examine which of those you can actually improve and take action while stop worrying for those you can’t. You might not be able to overcome genetics but you can certainly improve your behavior, your haircut, your health and your body!  **4. Self-Assertiveness:** You stay true to your wants, needs, and values no matter the pressure you get from other people. It is the willingness to stand up for yourself even if sometimes what you do or believe is not so popular. “My life does not belong to others and I am not here on earth to live up to someone else’s expectations.” Men with low Self-Assertiveness fail shit-tests.  **5. Living Purposefully:** It means you are productive, that you take action every day to achieve your goals. Be specific, visualize what you really want in your life and make a plan. Measure your progress as you go on.  **6. Personal Integrity:** When we behave in ways that conflict with our judgment of what is appropriate, we lose face in our own eyes. We respect ourselves less. If the policy becomes habitual, we trust ourselves less or cease to trust ourselves at all. Integrity means congruence. Words and behavior match. For example: If you said today that you will go to the gym but you end up not doing it. You will lose some of your Personal Integrity, you will stop trusting yourself and what goals you set to yourself.  **Conclusion**  To the extent that the six pillars are integrated into our daily life, self-esteem is supported and strengthened. To the extent that they are not, self-esteem is undermined and subverted. One of the vital things The Red Pill teaches us is to respect ourselves, if we respect ourselves other people will follow.  
Ex5: I have dealt with Emotional issues from since I was a child.  I had a really ""difficult"" household, so I grew up insecure.   when you're parents are having a hard time expressing themselves in healthy ways because they themselves deal with emotional issues then they become overly critical and you as a child get to internalize self-criticism and this self-criticism is exactly what weakens your frame. you can call it ""self-shit test"".  the problem with critical parents is that up until age 8, their critical attitude traumatizes you and fills you with triggers that develop as you age and then you gather even more triggers and then you find yourself fear of rejection\ failure\ self-sabotage \ care too much about what other think\ etc.  the reason to all of those symptoms are those same traumas from childhood. you're not supposed to fear rejection THIS much. you don't suppose to fear failure THIS much and you're not supposed to be overly critical. all of those are emotional ""baggage"".  this emotional baggage make it difficult for you to concentrate and believe in yourself so you fail to achieve your goal and then you're self-esteem deteriorates and all of this makes you're frame weak and fragile.   to try and fake a strong frame is much harder than to heal those traumas and become actually strong. the way to do it is by using your imagination, people call this ""NLP"".   I went to therapy not so long ago which helped a lot and one of the exercises the therapist did, stuck with me and now I do it to myself because he just guided me through the visualization which I can do by myself and it works. it is a process but I am a living proof that it helps.   yesterday I found a book wrote by ""Tael swan"". she's an international therapist and she described the same exercise that the therapist did with me, and the book describes the theory behind it and explains step by step how to work with it.   for all of you, this can change lives. it goes father beyond just game and woman. your health depends on resolving those issues. so for those who want to become stronger the book called - ""The Completion Process"" by Tael Swan. (Kindle version is very cheap so everybody can afford it)

Ex1: **Summary:** This is a hard hitting response to the #DearDaddy feminist propaganda video that went viral last month (a rape culture video made by a charity called CARE Norway).  &amp;nbsp;  **Link :** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32GDOHN-ePI ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32GDOHN-ePI)  &amp;nbsp;  **Keynotes**  &amp;nbsp;    * The reason boys call girls bitches cunts and whores is because these kind of girls simply exist   * Adults should be responsible for their own safety, therefore if you get coma drunk in a public place, you deserve a part of the blame   * Women who trap their boyfriend with pregnancy are the most selfish mothers and should be shamed by society   * Domestic violence stories often have 2 sides, and men don’t start hitting women just like that for no reason   &amp;nbsp;  **Thoughts**  &amp;nbsp;  A cultural change is about to happen. If you look at the comments on the care video, you see that most people see it for what it is. If you pay attention to the latest news, you will also notice that the SJW war is spreading everywhere. Anti-feminism/ Anti SJW is going more mainstream, with guys like Milo and Bill Burr calling out feminist bullshit.   &amp;nbsp;  Side note: feminism has corrupted charities like Care Norway and others. If you go to their websites you will see they are now trying to invade poor African countries with their ideologies, while giving them money at the same time. They’re brainwashing poor children at a young age so they can’t defend themselves. Check out other charities like “because I am girl”, very telling.
Ex2: As a conservative/Libertarian type, one thing that makes my fucking day is to see leftists suffer the unintended consequences of their bullshit policies. Exhibit A for today: Women have been claiming for so long that they're equal to men in every way that people are starting to believe them. They celebrated winning the right to go into combat without really thinking through what that means. Par for the course for leftists. Now they're freaking out because the military has said, ""Great, so now that you're the equal of a man, you get to be eligible for the draft!""   What's especially great about this is that feminists are exposing themselves with their reactions. Many are blowing the whistle on themselves, saying ""Wait, feminism isn't about equality."" This is news to most everybody but us.   Also, it shoves their face into an uncomfortable fact - rights and privileges come with obligations attached. They've never understood this, but honestly, I think that this is our way out. They have to be made to realize this. Once they do, 99% of them will want to be housewives.   https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/02/02/army-and-marine-corps-chiefs-its-time-for-women-to-register-for-the-draft/
Ex3: Do you know what the saddest part is? Do you know who papered this bill in the parliament? A cuckolded AFC beta male MP. Jesus fucking christ a MALE !!  https://www.rt.com/news/345458-canada-anthem-gender-neutral/  Jesus fucking christ, man; I don't want to live in this fucking country anymore. Anyone that lives in Canada will know what I am talking about when I say that Canada is currently the epicenter of third wave feminism in this world.  Examples:  [Protesters shut down U of O professor's men's rights talk.](http://www.metronews.ca/news/ottawa/2014/04/10/protesters-shut-down-u-of-o-professors-mens-rights-talk.html)  [Man Faces 6 Months in Jail For Disagreeing With Feminists on Twitter.](http://www.infowars.com/man-faces-6-months-in-jail-for-disagreeing-with-feminists-on-twitter/)  [Feminists Go Crazy After Jian Ghomeshi Found Not Guilty Of Rape.](http://www.returnofkings.com/83865/feminists-go-crazy-after-jian-ghomeshi-found-not-guilty-of-rape)  And on, and on, and on, and on...  Let's not forget the 6's and the 5's walking in the downtown core pretending to be over entitled 10's all over the god damned place. Fuck this country.
Ex4: I've traveled all around, and also met people from all sorts of different countries and cultures, and I've definitely noticed a correlation. The places where feminists are the angriest, most ""oppressed"" and highest in percentage are the most liberal places where guys are the most blue pilled, passive and accepting of bad female behavior, such as Berkeley, San Francisco, and Los Angeles (all places I've lived in). These places usually also have a high percentage of single mothers, or if Dad was kept around, he allowed himself to be berated and dominated by Mom and the kids, so either way, kids were raised without a strong paternal figure to tell them when it's time to stop bitching and go be productive. Their daughters grow up to spend their lives crying about how men oppress them and abuse them all day, when in reality most of the men in their lives are sniveling wimps who duck their heads and apologize.  On the other hand, when I go to the South or meet women from non-Western countries, it's completely different. These are places that are still ""patriarchal,"" where men are openly sexist, still enforce submission in women and won't take their shit, and none of these women hate men, nor do they give two shits about feminism or believe in ""the Patriarchy,"" even though the societies they live in could very well be classified as one. They're actually happy with their place in society. And there are still plenty of smart, career-oriented women that come from these places, but they're still able to get along just fine with all the men in their lives without finding ways to get oppressed by them.   So, are the women in liberal places more angry, miserable and incapable of relating to males because the submissive, groveling Nice Guys they deal with are secretly oppressing them more than traditional men are? Or is the whole thing just their feminine way of expressing their frustration with the lack of true male energy and discipline in their lives, crying out for a strong hand to bitchslap them and tell them to shut the fuck up? This may be worth discussing, because it's very possible that the best way for men to beat feminism is for us to just...well...be men.

------------------------------

Ex1: tldr: Black women are the most masculine women out of all the women i've dealt with.     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROtEft8VC58   In my experience with dealing with women of all different races.  I find that black women are the worst when it comes to displaying feminine characteristics.    As a black man myself, I feel that we as black men have been introduced to feminism early on in our lives.  While feminism is unfortunately growing in popularity, black men have a lot of experience in dealing with this due to the fact that black women tend to be on the extreme side when it comes to this.  Their extreme case of masculinity has to be the biggest turn off when I have to deal with black women.  EDIT: I forgot to mention that I am referring to American black women.  Foreign black women are much more submissive and feminine than the women I mentioned above.   Do you feel that black women are the least feminine?  
Ex2: Last attempt at updating failed because I linked to the previous post. Just search this same title without the ""(Update)"" if you're lost. Or search my post history  -----  **TL;DR** - The officer who made the call did so without authorization. He was a white knight who tried to bait me into going down and incriminating myself. He was suspended without pay for a very short time, and I was told will be under strict monitoring when he returns. The LTR made sure to convey the fact that I did nothing wrong.  -----  So I *did* notice that the voicemail was a little scratchy, like it came from mobile. It didn't come from a landline. I still called the LTR, noticeably pissed.  She insisted she only told them my first name, and she said, ""after I realized the conclusion that they immediately came to when I said we got into a 'fight', I went stone faced and reiterated that you didn't do anything bad"". She said one officer was just jotting things down, and the other was trying to extract more information about me, but she wouldn't budge.  LTR called the station with me on the other line, and had their badge numbers as identification, and once I gave them the number that called me, they confirmed it was the ""interrogator"" officer's cell phone. After a short pause, they said he used his **company computer** to search her Facebook, and get my name. From there, getting my cell number was a piece of cake. The other officer's notes confirm what the LTR said. We actually talked to him on the phone, he said he's been doing this for 20 years, he knows signs when he sees them, and we were good.   The officer was given two week's suspension without pay, and will be on heavy watch when he returns. The LTR and I will both be filling restraining orders against this officer.  This went from a lesson in not trusting women, to always being on the lookout for white knights.
Ex3: Hey Brothers (and sisters)   I have been here in NYC since election night. I thought I'd share some observations and on the ground field research.  http://www.rawlings.com/site-content/gold-glove-gallery.html   I am here working the Rawlings Gold Glove awards.. (crew)... there are some pics on the link. Charlie Sheen/Joe Piscopo and a lot of other absolutely Alpha Bro's not to mention all that testosterone from the 18 best defensive players in Baseball...   So... two blocks down are all the SJW fucks 'protesting' the election.   Tuesday Night: Walked around times square, up and down Fifth avenue, Union Square..... Shock. The quietest I have ever seen NYC. A Few girls are holding up F-Trump signs with the usual boring mono-narrative sexist,racist,xenophobic and ABLEist (new one to me... had to look it up)  Yawwwnnnnn.   Wednesday Night..  Have to walk a maze to get to work from my hotel. Streets are being blocked for 'the protesters""... makes me 15 minutes late to work. I hear the 'protesters' and there is a definite feminine ring to the chants.... I look out the window of the Plaza Hotel... You would have thought it was the suffragettes...80% female, 90% White.     The Crew I was with ran to the windows to flame them and yell ""I voted for him...so what?""  Thursday Night: Protests begin on time like a TV show. Not all Hillary Voters. Just the wealthier ones. Though NYC is one of the most diverse cities in the world, the 'protesters' are overwhelmingly WHITE and FEMALE!!! ?????  Now Laborers,waiters,janitors can't get to work... Mostly foreign born/language speaking males.... Hmmmm???   Friday Night... Awards show goes off great. Total different post. All my childhood heroes. Brooks Robinson is STILL a stud....   Today...off day. Walking the streets, central park, the Plaza.... Long Trails of virtually all white women (with the occasional Mangina) carrying their signs, chanting their BS (My Body, My choice)   **TL;DR**.. A lot of pre-wall white girls gaining attention to support their BP narrative at the expense of working class people of color/foreign born...  they eat their own
Ex4: **TL;DR;** Don't play the White Knight, especially with guns.    Introducing T.J. Antell, RIP the White Knight. TJ. owned a crossfit studio and was well liked enough (lifting folks ?) to be smashing decent pussy(picture provided). He seems have been working on some sort of combo hipster/zero dark thirty delta-force look.   T.J. also decided to get a concealed carry permit and go down to the local Texas Walgreens and live out his Vigilante  Social Justice fantasy. This didn't work out well because:    1. Lots of other people in Texas have guns. 2. His designated Black Knight was done shooting at the presumed princess and so had time to shoot him. 3. There's no Cross Fit or Krav Maga move for being shot in the face by someone who can aim. 4. Risk Reward ratio for being the White Knight is ~infinity.    TJ thought he was ""The Punisher"" and was restoring Truth, Justice and the American Way. Now instead of laying out gym bunnies and enjoying the burn like Chad, he's laying in a drawer in the local morgue. His SO wins the pity Olympics though. And the state of Texas will be spending $1000k on prosecuting and locking up the Black Knight (no pun intended), who has gone from ankle shooter to killer.  **Don't be T.J**    [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/05/03/he-thought-he-could-help-concealed-carry-gun-wielder-intervenes-in-domestic-dispute-and-is-shot-dead/?tid=pm_national_pop_b]

Ex1: Hi Everyone,  **UPDATE - I am going to talk to her about the money / sex comment she made last night and tell her it is unacceptable way to speak / treat me if we are to get married and that I will not stand for it. I will let you know how it goes **  Thank you for all the feedback you have provided. I have decided to write this separate post because there were just to many comments to reply to on my original post.  There are some issues that need to be faced. I know deep down I need to face them and I don't think 'next' is the correct answer. When I wrote my post, I didn't write anywhere saying what should I do? or please help, I didnt post to ASKTRP, I posted to TRP. I ended my post with with ""This is the red pill theories in action. Women don't love men like men love women. I love my fiance, but she obviously doesn't love me like i love her.""  I was trying to show everyone that women don't love us like we love them, it is conditional. We have the burden of performance which I am obviously not living up to. I wasn't asking, how do I break up with her?  Think about this, I break up with my Fiance, then what happens? Unless I improve myself, raise my SMV, perform better, I will either a) settle for someone below my SMV or b) have the same thing happen to me again. Wouldn't it be better for me to raise my SMV and performance before breaking up? Therefore being single and high SMV rather than single and low SMV? Seems like a much better position of power.  The thing is my Fiance is very attractive, high SMV and my SMV is obviously to low at the moment. Which means that in terms of the level of SMV I have obtained in a partner, I am doing very well  The comments section mainly said break up with her, but I got some good PM's from people that I am very grateful for.  I am going to focus on the root cause of the issue, rather than the bandaid break up response. I am going to focus on my SMV and my ability to provide.  But mark my words, I do have my limits and my line in the sand, any cheating or nonsense like that will be an automatic breakup and I will not budge on that one.  We all have our different amounts of red pill. Some people will never marry, some do and thats why we have the married red pill. I will marry, but I am not going to be walked all over. My plan at the moment is: - Increase SMV - Incease burden of performance - Implement Dread  any feedback on my tactics would be appreciated, but simple lines like dump her are not helpful.  I will update the red pill regularly because my original post was very popular 500+ comments and I will let you all know how I go. If I crash and burn and get divorce raped, you will all know about it. 
Ex2: **Introduction**  *The Cock Carousel™ and Bitch Face™ go together for a reason.*  &amp;nbsp;  **Body**  The Cock Carousel™ does heavy damage to the subconscious mind of women.  Try to imagine what a women is going through.  Her body is hormonally designed to mate with the male she is attached to and when that linkage is destroyed it creates in her mind a sort of wound.  High N Count women develop the Thousand Cock Stare™ which is the accumulation of this damage over time.  The **more attractive** the woman (SMV 8 or SMV 9) in our ""Current Year"" culture the more damage she likely absorbs.  The Bitch Face™ is both the natural reaction to the damage and also encouraged by Feminism.  When women are unhappy they naturally wear the Bitch Face™ because they feel bad and express that as being bitchy.  They feel like crap and want you to break her free of it.  &amp;nbsp;  *Masculine polarity makes women happy.*  &amp;nbsp;  If you ever observe the successful LTR / Marriage couples the ***women are always smiling***.  You just don't see unhappy women when they are near her prized Alpha male.  &amp;nbsp;  **Conclusion**  The Bitch Face™ is created by the Cock Carousel™.  If you see the Bitch Face™ you know she is:  &amp;nbsp;  * Damaged by the Cock Carousel™.  * Likely of high SMV.  * Observing the guidance of Feminism that says it's good idea. (not)  * Very unhappy because she has no man. (wounded and angry bitch)  * Seeking a masculine man because as her prize it makes her ***SMILE***.  &amp;nbsp;  Turn that Bitch Face™ into a ***SMILE*** and you achieved masculine polarity in the relationship.  One might even say this is the best litmus test for the presence of masculine polarity.  &amp;nbsp;  *Men love women, women love children, children love puppies.*  &amp;nbsp;  Your pet should (ideally) be well trained, obedient, happy and:  &amp;nbsp;  ***SMILING***.  &amp;nbsp;     
Ex3: Decided to make a post out of this since my comment would be drowned otherwise. I'll keep it short.  &gt; A hot girl doesn’t make you nervous because she’s hot, she makes you nervous because sleeping with her represents a personal victory, and getting rejected by her represents a personal defeat.   While this is correct, it doesn't explain WHY it is a personal victory / defeat.  It's all about value. All of us have a certain idea about our own SMV. Women have this too. When a low SMV man approaches a woman, who perceives herself as higher SMV than that man, she will take it as an insult. Why? Because she believes the man to be of a lower SMV, and if he thinks he has a shot with her, he must see her SMV as close to his. This is the insult: the man implicitly tells the woman she's low(er) SMV. Experienced redpillers will have been approached by lower SMV women and thought: 'you really believe you stand a chance getting with me?'. Couple this with insecurity and you get a woman's mind, and why they take it as an insult/personal defeat.   TRP's goal is to increase SMV. When you've 'proven' your SMV by (repeatedly, or LTR) getting a woman of a certain SMV, you'll no longer get nervous with women of her SMV. 'Hot girls' that make you nervous will have a higher SMV (in your own  subjective opinion) than you attribute to yourself. This poses the opportunity to measure your perceived SMV in her eyes, and your own: getting with 'hot girls' (consistently) means your SMV is above theirs (women only date up)!   So getting with this hot girl feels like a true evaluation of your SMV, and thát is what makes you nervous.   If you would get her, it'd feel like a personal victory (higher SMV). If you wouldn't it'd feel like a personal defeat (lower SMV).  Disclaimer: how women see your SMV depends on how you act. If you get nervous, she'll know, and link it with a low self worth (low SMV). Take the woman of the pedestal, ignore your emotion, be rational, behave as you would with a low SMV girl and prove her (and yourself) your SMV is higher than hers!
Ex4: So I'm currently in the anger/jaded fucking hatred phase it would seem.   There's something that's been bothering me for a long time, and I hope you guys can help me think about it differently or something. It is the disparity between how Rollo's SMV peaks play out in the real world. Rollo states that women's SMV ""burns fast and hot"" while men's ""burns long and slow""...as if this is some sort of wash. It certainly doesn't seem like it.  &amp;nbsp;  In the US, particularly outside of the giant metropolitan areas, people marry for the first time in their mid-20s. Which means they are single from 18 to around 22-23(their college years). At this point, women's SMV is peaking, so they can...without any effort...have a ton of casual fun and truly experience their ""party years"", before cashing in their chips on the best guy who's around at the end of college (when her SMV is still high). So women get to USE their SMV peak easily to get BOTH plenty of casual fun AND a high value husband. These husbands seem to be 1-2 years older than them.   &amp;nbsp;  Men's SMV on the other hand is in the toilet from 18-22, so they work extremely hard on self-improvement, social skills, etc in order to reap minimal returns(if any). Many are like me, and didn't find out about the red pill until they were in their mid-20s, at which point the ""everyone's single"" years are gone. The theory here, is that a man who goes into his late 20's or early 30's single will be peaking in terms of his SMV....but what fucking good is it at that point? All the quality women he previously didn't have access to would theoretically be available to him now...but they're all fucking married and popping out kids. That means he has to look to younger women, but those younger women are now peaking, so it's not exactly some sort of cake-walk. Let's say you're 30 and looking for a wife because you want kids and a family (yeah yeah, we get it, we know you think marriage is bullshit, save your comments). That means you have to either A. Find a needle in a haystack (high value woman who's still unmarried and childless in late 20s) or B. You have to wife up some 22 year old who's not very mature, and who has a very highly inflated sense of her own value because she never experienced the decline.   &amp;nbsp;  Help me think about this a different way, because right now, the only way I see this working out well for men is if they are not interested in having a family and only want to use their peak SMV to hook up with young women in their party phase. It seems like if a man wants a family, he has to settle in his mid-20s for a woman below him in value, or get the sloppy seconds version of a woman who was high value but now is divorced with a couple of kids (shudder).

Ex1: Guys, I love you, I love Red Pill. Here's my field report.  After two months on Tinder, versus Match, for ME I gotta say all this 'game' stuff works WAY better on Match -- for ME.  I loved Match. I couldn't believe how swell it was.   I had a ratio of 90/10 on first dates. No, not for sex, but heavy make outs, in her car or mine, usually and then after three dates -- boom!   It was a great pre-selection process.  But got off Match last year when I got an LTR. (From Match. A real honey, with a mouth that wouldn't quit, mmm hmm.)  So very recently,the LTR vacated my premises. All love and light on all sides, yessireebob, no bad karma around it, I still care for her, she for me, mm hmm.  Yet gone. (And I gotta say, I'm kind of relieved. I don't particularly love living with a lover. I like room mates big time and I like my dog. But not someone in my bed every fucking night. I like to fart. I like to roll over and pee in beer cans. I like to stay up till three watching PLATOON for the ninth time while I smoke a cigar and hurl dirty socks at my cat.  Tinder intrigued me. Seemed like a sure thing - pure attraction, yes? And, er, FREE.  Ten minutes after I first went on Tinder, BAM! I have a match with this hot 40 year old (I'm 52) and I'm thinking -- Tinder is the bomb.  Lordy!  But that first one?  Didn't work out.  (Ex-Mormon, Daddy and brothers fucked her, my goodness, it was an Arkansas family reunion and she was crazy from the storm, my droogs -- with an ex-husband fresh out of jail for domestic abuse (and an LAPD detective.)  Er, no.  And ninety percent of my Tinder dates have been BAD.   In fact, over the last weeks, Tinder proffered me a string of crazy bitches that you would think could not exist outside of an Adam Sandler shitfest.  So my question to you is: WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE ON THE TWO SITES: AS PER RATIOS OF GOOD DATES VERSUS BAD DATES?  I.e. For those of you who have been on both TINDER &amp; MATCH, what is the ratio of good dates (defined as hook ups, or immediate make outs, or just 'hey I had a great time with a non crazy psycho') to bad dates (defined as 'I wanted to eat my own sac afterwards'). Okay.  Here's my DATA RATIOS:  RATIO OF GOOD DATES to BAD DATES on Tinder: 10/90 RATIO OF GOOD DATES TO BAD DATES on Match:  90/10  What are your data ratios?  That's my question, guys. And any illumination you have to offer on why you got the ratio you did!  Thank you!  PS - I'm going on a Tinder date this Saturday (if she isn't imprisoned or institutionalized before then) and I'll give you a report.  But I'm ready to go back on Match.  I hope this was informative to my RP brothers, and would love to hear your own field reports.  Namaste, bitches! 
Ex2: My background 23 y virgin, discovered trp 2 weeks ago joined a gym and started doing pickup and tinder. This was my greatest success thus far. I know i'm very physically atractive, I have a deep suave voice and i'm tall. I'm balding but it's not that noticeable. My problem has always been my mindset. TRP is helping me change my conditioning and my life has been improving drastically.    Met a cutie on tinder, arranjed a date after she flaked twice (I just didn't next her because she seemed into me and was really flirty and hot) a couple of times. Later I realized she was scared of meeting some stranger at night (lesson taken) so I just set up a day date. Anyways I met her and it started to rain, preemptively I had an umbrella so she just grabbed my swollen bicep and off we went.  During the walk we kept talking about stuff like music and just generally boring shit so I tried escalating a bit and said I was a porno movie director when she asked me what I did for a living. I was looking for a star preformer I told her. She laughed it off saying it was quite the compliment. A couple of mins later I told her what I really did though. She studies the same thing I do so I guess it was some common ground that I really needed to find because there were a couple of awkward silences during our walk.   We stopped at this coffee house that was packed so I just took her to another place nearby and we got a couple of drinks which I payed for (she wanted to pay hers but I insisted, I know shouldn't have done this, it's still my bp habits). Mine was this long island iced tea (which looked really girly but idgaf) and hers was a caipirinha. We had a great talk I believe, she kept saying stuff we should do in the future which I see as a good sign. Overall she was really funny and flirty. I then switched venues and we drank a couple of beers (she paid for these) and then went to have dinner on this canteen because she wanted to save money.  I also ended up paying for this but because they didn't take her card.  After dinner I took her to this small pub and I knew I had to make the move because lots of time had gone by (3 and a half hours). I sat next to her on a sofa, put her hand on her thigh and kissed her to which she reciprocated and we ended up going out and making out in a street corner. I was about to reach down with my hand in her pants and she stopped me. She asked me if in my country we didn't tongue kiss (I probably am a shitty kisser) and asked me if I thought she kissed well (qualification? I said she did though). We walked to the river downtown and I held her hand but in a weird degenerate way like i was shaking her hand and she swiftly adjusted my hand (I'd never held hands before. And i know this was bp behavior again). Anyways we went to this park where we made out again, this time I was biting her, pushing her against a tree, pulling her hair and dodging her kisses and she seemed to love it, she seemed really horny. She asked me if I always take girls to the park and I told her, well, I never take them to the cantine. Also she asked me how many girls I've shagged and I told her a prime number (we both studied maths). She said, I can't have sex with you tonight because this is a bad week (period I guess). I said don't worry about it (fkn bp behavior again). Made out again and took her home. I kept groping her during our walk and had a raging erection throughout the whole night which she surely felt when we made out.   I texted her 2 days later saying ""when will we meet up again?"" to which she replied ""Uhh I don't know"". I'll try to meet up next week if she flakes I'll next her. 
Ex3: Threw a little party on Friday for St. Patty's day. In order to even up the ratio (which actually ended up skewed towards women, lol) I invited two of my plates who I didn't really value that much to come. As often happens, while I was expecting about 20-25 people to show, only about 10 people were around and 5 came later, so it was smaller and more intimate than I had hoped for.  They both showed up on their own, dressed very nice with black leather jackets looking good. As people were socializing I slowly realized that they were inevitably going to talk, and of course one of the questions would be: ""So how do you know cap1tal1sm?"" Now, one of them I met at a bar and the other Tinder, but I told the Tinder girl not to say Tinder, which she was totally fine with lol.    That didn't really matter. Despite my and my bros best efforts, they inevitably started talking and we confirmed that they both told the other that they met me in a bar. They **BOTH** knew that I was or had been banging the other.  That didn't matter either. When I got either one of them alone they were all over me, trying to make out with me and get me to themselves. I have simply **no doubt** that they knew they were only one of many girls.   *And they liked it.* Hell, they even shared an uber back together HAHAHAHA. Texting them afterwards they're as motivated as ever to hang out.  Someone mentioned in another post that the harem is actually the optimal situation to be in. This is a real, direct data point that confirms that suspicion. They *love* to be one of many girls competing for my commitment and attention.

------------------------------

Ex1: One of the most predictable reactions when someone breaks free of blue pill condtioning, and begins to truly see the world for what it is, is anger. The term used to describe this initial stage of freedom on here is ""The Anger Phase."" Whilst most would say that anger is a temporary thing, eventually fading away, as u/redpillschool pointed out in his excellent post, anger really isn't a phase. Nor should it be, really. Anger is good. What isn't healthy, however, is bitterness.   There often exists a conflating of anger and bitterness. After all, bitterness usually stems from anger that found no outlet and festered, turning from the potentially useful potent energy of rage to the dormant rancor that harms only the person it inhabits.   It must be understood that only one thing separates the angry man from the bitter man:action. Anger, when used as it was meant to, fuels you to make decisions and take action to effect change. This drains the energy from the anger, but emotions are perfectly capable of re-filling, and when it does, you get that extra kick in the rear end again--always in a good way. When no action is taken, the anger turns on itself and hardens and coagulates into a poisonous substance.   The argument can be made that one really ought to let go of anger at some point, and if that works for you, then good. For many,though, anger is just what the red pill doctor ordered, and it provides the impetus to creating a life in line with what you truly want.   In more relatable terms, anger is the old man who plants thorn bushes around his lawn so the kids won't ruin his grass. Bitterness is the other old man who just sits and watches his lawn get ruined whilst mumbling about how kids today have no respect. Both recognise the situation for what it is, but only one processes it in a manner that will allow them to change and come out on top..   Anger is dynamic. Bitterness is stagnant.
Ex2: White knight judge shows great understanding and compassion for homicidal mother in NYC.   http://nypost.com/2016/05/18/city-teacher-who-poisoned-drowned-her-kids-gets-8-years-in-jail/  I'm still in the anger phases but this is amazing to me.   Maybe this will be a new trend for divorcing women to kill their kids in the rare instance they don't get their way in court and judges signing off on it. Plus parents of her students even donated to her defense. This would never happen for a man.  I'm curious what TRP thinks if such compassion for emotionally turmoil would ever be offered to a man going through a divorce or other life change.  
Ex3: To be to totally honest I thought I skipped the anger phase, I really did. Sure I was pissed when it came crashing down that being a white knight would only fuck me in the end but I moved past that when I realized the measurable improvements I could make to my life to course correct.  Then  I dug my teeth into the rest of the side bar theory reading. I'm barely 3 pages into The Misandry Bubble and I want to fucking scream. How the flying fuck could I be so blind as to the divorce rape that's happening and the vomit inducing inequality of divorce laws. How the fuck can feminism even think to make claims that it wants equality of genders when it allows this shit to happen? I knew feminism was bullshit, but what I didn't understand that it's from a place worse than hell for any man affected by it.  This is injustice in the truest sense and it's sickening. Suffice to say I'm glad I found the red pill  Edit: added flair
Ex4: I read frequently TRP and also other ""men's issues"" subs. Many posts in there show the glaring bias against men and show situations where men are put in a bad situation just because of their gender. This causes me to be angry instantly, which is a normal reaction.  Many times I have gone through the day, the week thinking about all those things and trying to make up in my brain a way to fix it. That caused more anxiety. Sometimes a need for revenge.  Obviously for most guys this boils down to nothing, just go back focusing on your daily duties. A few would expose this anger and revenge by nothing more than not going out for lunch with that female co-worker or acting as a jerk. However, a very few would possibly make the worse, like hurting someone. And here is what I have to say to you. Do not be mad that things are like they are, because:  1. Women are biased by genetics. They just cannot escape their jerk behavior because it is coded in their DNA. This will never change because it is rooted in biological reasons.  2. Women are stupid. When she comes to you asking to fix that faucet, it is not because she is entitled. It is because she just cannot do it. Women have very low spatial reasoning and have a hard time figuring out the 3D world.  3. Women need protection. And when I say ""need"" means they cannot live in this world without adult protection. They are physically weak. They are scared the entire day. That is why feminism degenerated these days to ask for MORE state protection to women, not less like the feminist's call in the 70s, Camille Paglia comes to mind.  4. Women do not have motivation to succeed - in average. Because of the low-T, their drive to fight - literally and mentallly - is very low. They cannot aspire to the top CEO position because that will require 80 hours/week and intense discipline to achieve. They know the only way to get to the top is with government intervention.  5. Women live scared all the time because they know they are weak, stupid, slow, without motivation.  When you free yourself from the chains of feminism, ie believing that women are as capable as men, is that your anger will subside into pity and understanding of the reality as it is.

"
4,Health / Abuse,"Ex1: Was looking for info on this throughout the sub reddit and couldn't find it. So I compiled my own guide from the advice of a criminal defence lawyer who has defended men falsely accused of rape.  You're always at risk of being fucked over by the feminine imperative, but by employing these simple precautions you can greatly reduce your odds  Before sex:  - on your first encounter, qualify that she doesn't share any SJW sentiments, doesn't have SJW friends and also isn't batshit crazy  - save any messages she sends you that imply she'd wanna fuck you, potentially fishing for them if need be by making the text conversation sexual  During sex:  - get her to put the condom on, making sure her fingerprints are on the condom and the wrapper (will explain why later)  - film it. Yes it's often illegal, but the only situation the police would find out is after you've already been accused, have hypothetically brought it up with your lawyer who has then recommended bringing fourth the recording. It's a no-lose, provided you don't fucking tell anyone you film yourself fucking. would you rather be penalised for filming... or for rape? (There are sneaky apps for filming that make doing it easy and retard-proof) I do not know if audio recordings would be permissible. Yes this is ""a bit much""... But if you've been seriously accused then this is your only real ace-in-the-hole.  After sex:  - take her out for breakfast, even if you don't want to (Mike Tyson said that if he'd just driven the girl home, he wouldn't have done time)  - at least text her saying you enjoyed last night (makes her feel like less of a slut, which discourages ""buyer's remorse"", And it's not something a rapist would do)  In the event of ""buyer's remorse"":  - dont apologise if she says she's upset about what happened, the apology will imply you raped her. Just say you enjoyed the experience and you hope to see her again (something which a rapist wouldn't say)  - if she says she's upset take her out to dinner in a public place and get her smiling etc... And don't ever see her again (something a rapist wouldn't do)  In the event of accusation:  - do not talk to the police. Literally not a fucking word. Don't pick up if they call you. They can just make shit up and they can and will lie to you. (Read some of the stories in the comments if you're not convinced)  - claim you've got the condom and the wrapper with her fingerprints on them, this might panic the bitch enough to drop the allegations  Most of this comes from Cernovich's website, so props to him, if you wanna read more and find out about the laws for recording and shit, check out his post http://www.dangerandplay.com/2011/09/21/how-to-avoid-a-false-rape-case/ and here's his podcast where you hear from the criminal defence lawyer about his case defending against a rape accusation and some of the shit cops will try to pull http://www.dangerandplay.com/2014/06/08/avoid-false-rape-accusation/  I've already started employing many of these practices and feel a lot more peaceful knowing I'm relatively safer. Hopefully you can experience this too.  EDIT: added other suggestions from commenters.
Ex2: I hear lots about how bad it is to be a man today. Fem-liberal agenda destroying men's rights etc etc but actually when has it ever been a better time to be a man than a woman. In every age as far as I can tell men have provided and women have stayed home and looked after children and the home. In every age it has been the men fighting, and dieing and getting crippled. I know, I know....""but what about those poor women who died in chilbirth'. How many were there?  10%, 30% ? How many men got septicaemia from minor wounds. Gee, I can be outside ploughing all day, or I can be inside where it is warm.Any profession before electricity was a tough one. Pick a time in history where men weren't dieing in their thousands. Pick a nation. I can't.    Again I hear the feminists cry, ""but women were raped and rape is bad."" No-one disputes rape was and is bad. Is it as bad as being dead? No. Is it as bad as being crippled or having 4ft of spear stuck through you? No again IMVHO. I know Hillary Clinton wants us to believe women are the real victims of war. Bullshit, women are the survivors of war, and every brother or husband they lose is probably also some mans brother or son or father. Look at the perks of being alive today. Vasectomies are quick and easy. There are lots of tools to reduce the effects of a lifetime of labour on our bodies. There is more contraceptive available and screening for a range of genetic defects so our children have more chance of being born healthy. The actual number of hours most men work is less now than at almost any other time in history, excluding depressions.   Yeah, our rights are getting eroded but the state is also stepping in. No longer do you have to get married to a girl just because you got her knocked  up.  tl,dr? It could be worse.       I am not a troll. I just think that instead of sitting around crying because feminists have all the power, either become a MRA or actually get on with life. Feminists are not that scarey. My fwb says she is a feminist. She still loves sucking my cock and being spanked. My other plate claims to be a feminist but she knows I am not monogamous and is still dtf. If you know your facts and show your willingness to disagree. You get far more respect than by agreeing with feminists.     For all those guys bleating about they can't do anything in case they face a rape charge orsexual harassment charge. Have you not learned anything about SMV. If she is begging you to fuck her it is not rape or sexual harassment.   Women still like a confident, sexually aware man. Women still like fit and healthy men. Women still like sex. Medicine has gotten to the point that most std's are treatable, no more dying of tertiary syphillus. We also have power tools, drag racing, mma, and so much more. I think it is a great time to be a man. So sue me.
Ex3: One of the many articles on this case: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-judge-who-asked-an-alleged-rape-victim-why-she-couldnt-keep-her-knees-together-might-lose-his-a7235601.html  tl;dr a judge in a rape case asked a the alleged victim why she couldn't keep her legs closed. Rather than assume the judge was trying, maybe in a brusque way, to figure out the fact of the case, pretty much the entire world assumes he's a misogynist rape apologist who thinks women get raped because they try to close their legs.  There's not much more to say really. At this point, the rape hysteria is so out of control law enforcement, judges and private citizens have enormous incentives to throw accused men under the bus rather than try to figure out the truth, because when they do not immediately and completely believe the accuser (which includes not asking too many questions) they're hit with all the power of extra-legal political and social shaming.  All of this, of course, constitutes a portion of the system constructed to keep men fearful and subservient to the Feminine Imperative: in all dealings with women men must be made to be fearful and submissive, so as to extract maximum resources from them.
Ex4: New essay at The Rational Male:  https://therationalmale.com/2017/12/18/dangerous-times-part-1/  Excerpt:  **Articles of Belief**  Shortly after I wrote Yes Means Fear I wrote Hysteria, an essay intended to address the disgraceful (now thoroughly proven) UVA fraternity rape hoax story written by Sabrina Erdley and published by a complicit Rolling Stone Magazine. Just daring to question the validity of so outrageous a rape account was heresy to women back then. Bear in mind this took place after the Yes Means Yes consent ruling in California. At this time, just to question the story of a woman’s rape account was enough to earn you the title of ‘rape apologist’. But moreover, we were popularly expected to repeat this mantra and always accept a woman’s account as infallibly true:  &gt;&gt;“No matter what Jackie said, we should automatically believe rape claims.” http://t.co/3HFlXR7jme True insanity pic.twitter.com/AFXIyn32FS  This was the sentiment (now deleted) tweeted by Zerlina Maxwell on December 6th, 2014. Since then this meme that anything a woman had to say about sexual assault must be believed by default has snowballed into a default belief that anything a woman alleges against a man must also be believed. Whereas a male college student might stand in front of his kangaroo court at a university, now men must stand in front of the kangaroo court of public opinion where a woman’s word outweighs all pretense of due process. That college kid is now the average man who must prove his innocence because if a woman alleges it due process is reversed.  **What we’ve witnessed in just 3 years is the systematic removal of a man’s right to habeas corpus with regard to women’s allegations.**  And I expect that this removal will extend to much more than just women’s believability in regard to sexual misconduct. Imagine a culture where it’s expected that anything a woman accuses her ex of is to be believed in divorce proceedings.  We’re now seeing exactly what myself, Deti, Dalrock and countless other Red Pill bloggers and commenters predicted would happen, but it’s also so much more that what we could see coming. In just 3 years Yes Means Yes moved off the campus and into mainstream culture; a culture predicated on female social primacy. In a feminine-primary social order even “affirmative consent” isn’t enough – “enthusiastic consent” must now be established and maintained. That “enthusiastic consent” is a new ambiguously defined terminology, and part of the larger narrative meant to further confuse and instill fear in men.

------------------------------

Ex1: **Introduction**  The difference between the Blue Pill and the Red Pill is Free Will.  &amp;nbsp;  **Body**  Let's review what is the Blue Pill:  &amp;nbsp;  * Emotional programming from school.  * Emotional programming from television.  * Emotional programming from your youthful peers.  * Emotional programming from your (single parent) mother.  &amp;nbsp;  The essential point is that you are being programmed by external forces from a young age and this is done emotionally and not intellectually.  You are taught the ""correct"" emotion for every situation and generally you don't think much about what might be happening below the surface of what you see.  This then translates to ideas like:  &amp;nbsp;  * Women are good.  * Women are never to be blamed.  * Women are strong and powerful.  * Women are entitled to everything without effort.  &amp;nbsp;  This picture of the Blue Pill is very **rigid** but based on emotional programming not objective reality.  &amp;nbsp;  The Red Pill then introduces the ""glitches"" that destroy the credibility of the Blue Pill brainwashing... which is best known in my opinion as a ""mythology"".  You are then thrust into a state of *cognitive dissonance*:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance  ...where the Blue Pill mythology now seems ""fake"" and you enter the ""Anger Phase"" in order to resolve this contradictory situation.  This is why the recent counter-meme of ""Fake Ideas"" was invented because if they can characterize the Red Pill type thinking as ""fake"" that creates confusion over ""which is really fake"".  The Blue Pill emotional programming is presented as ""truth"" all along and the Red Pill is the act of **exposing** that it's ""fake"" or as I prefer to say it's a ""mythology"".  So this ""It's Fake"" meme going around is a Blue Pill ""psychological operation"" designed to keep you from waking up.  They are toying with your emotions again. (no surprise)  &amp;nbsp;  * ***Free Will***  &amp;nbsp;  We finally are at the point where Free Will enters the picture.  Once the rigid emotional programming of the Blue Pill is destroyed you are in a state of being intellectually adrift.  Notice how in the Manosphere we get a huge variation in how people **react** to what they realize is the ""truth"" after they wake up.  We get people who prefer:  &amp;nbsp;  * MGTOW (independence)  * ONS (independence)  * Plate Spinning (independence)  * LTR (masculine polarity)  * Married Red Pill (masculine polarity)  &amp;nbsp;  We get this divergence because we act on our own Free Will and decide how we personally see things fitting together.  It's our ability to ""connect the dots"" outside emotional influences that makes us have Free Will.  Our ""will"" is not emotionally controlled by outside forces so it ""goes it's own way"".  &amp;nbsp;  **Conclusion**  Free Will is a byproduct of the Red Pill awakening.  Once you destroy the Blue Pill mythology (which is rigid emotional programming) it gives you the ability to think for yourself (for the first time) and that inevitably creates outcomes that match each person's inclinations.  &amp;nbsp;  * *Are we here to judge others?*  &amp;nbsp;  No.  The Red Pill is amoral.  You can be married and have a family and be the most awesome Alpha father who demonstrates top level Amused Mastery to create a family structure of masculine polarity where all your dependents are very happy being under you.  Or you just as easily decide that you want to never have kids and get a vasectomy so that you can maximize the number of sex partners without consequences.  Free Will creates **contradictory** outcomes...  and that is fine.  *The Red Pill defeats rigidity.*  &amp;nbsp;  
Ex2: TL/DR: Using Amused Mastery. The how and why.    I have a daughter. Once she crossed the age of 5, I noticed how much her sassiness had increased. Albeit the external world has, and will continue to rub off on her, it's up to me to game her correctly. This means approaching most topics with amused mastery. I am not and don't ever want to be some Gronk who can't handle my fragile little girls emotional state. She needs to be gently manipulated. She also needs to see a master at work so that she can one day find the right man who may possibly be a close model of me.    I've gotten amazing at reading body language. There are many sources out there that you can research to show you how to read people. Most of us also have an emotional intelligence built in, but some of us have a higher one than others. I suggest you take an emotional intelligence questionnaire to see what level you read people's facial expressions at, and then research some methods to help you understand more of what a person says with their face so that you can apply the correct game in every situation.    It's not always about being a dick or aloof. There is a push pull aspect that is involved in every aspect of game, especially that HB9 you walk up to in the bar. Of course there are many intricate styles of game. True masters understand women to their core enough to know what trigger to pull, and when.    If you want to get better at amused mastery, have a child. KIDDING. You can pick up some amused mastery books (child psychology, RP style.). Even if she's a 5'7, 21 year old, blonde bombshell, I treat her like she's 10. That's because most women want a man they can look up to, those from good homes with strong alpha fathers especially. They like a man that can put them in their place with subtle tactics that leave them saying to themselves, ""wow!""    So anytime a women adds **nothing to a conversation,** or adds something that makes the conversation **lack progression,** you used amused mastery. And if we break down amused mastery, we can see the inner workings of how and why to use it.     When a women has a gripe, she will call for the conversation to lack progression. When she gripes, she wants someone to listen. She is griping because she is emotional, uncomfortable, or not getting her way. And your response is what can change the conversations direction.     She is reaching out for a form of empathy. She wants this. And when you use **sarcasm in a form of understanding,** it allows her train of thought to change.     You are using amused mastery to say, ""hey doll, I get it. Been there, done that. But it's okay, see why?"" Just like a father would to his daughter. ""I'm stronger and more experienced than you, I promise you will be okay.""     Now obviously you don't actually say these things aloud. You cannot, it's insulting. So you change your speech to be slightly more disingenuous. This in turn is amusing to her. She sees the situation in a new light.   **Example:**   *You do something she doesn't like.*    *""That's not fair!""* (with a little pouting.)    **BAD RESPONSE:** *""Good, because I don't care!""*    **AMUSED MASTERY:** *""No, but if it were the fair, we'd definitely ride the Ferris wheel.""* (with a wink or cunning smile.)   Notice how quickly the conversation changes. You're now back in control.        
Ex3: I'm in a unique position of being a social retard putting in the work to social grace.  I've read up on the subject and found some interesting material on social dynamics, group talk, and empathy. I've had multiple epiphanies I want to share with you all.   **You need a filter**   If you're anything like me you like, to talk to everyone, give everyone at least a glance, and to win over everyone. It isn't possible, so choose your battles **after** you've made first contact. Decide if you want to talk to someone after you've already reached out.  **Every woman/man that doesn't ignore you  wants you in some way, just ask**    Life is too short to dance around social bushes. If a woman or man is interested in you they will reveal themselves on some level. Treat it like a dial, not a light switch. Reveal can be anything from a glance in your direction every 20 minutes to her brushing her breasts across your shoulder( yea, I'm short) and making eye contact. Once you recognize any amount of interest approach him/her and decide for yourself if the relationship is worth developing.  A leader does three things:  - assign roles, tasks, and value to relationships;  - prioritize energy and time to people;  - and gather information.   This is your new job; don't neglect it.  **Expressing anger onto people/things is futile**  - I was at the gym and a large man decided to make fun of me loudly, then got upset when I decided to ask him about it.   - A woman at the local convenient store got upset with me for not acknowledging her sexual advances.   - I got pissed at my neighbor for calling my landlord over a minor dispute.    What is the common denominator?    Nothing changed until the anger subsided!  - The woman went from yelling in the front of the store, hoping I'd give in to her shit test to giving me ""I want to fuck you"" eyes from the opposite end of the store.  - ‘Roid rage went from a studdly, popular man in the gym to crazy, unstable boy who can't seem to handle his own emotions.  - I went from nervous, unproductive mess to discussing pleasantries with the same neighbor (he now makes a point to stop and talk to me every time he catches me outside).   **Gain some emotional intelligence,  but don't use it**  I spent some time learning how to read emotions and learning good actions to alleviate them. In the process I realized that people need to feel emotions! It takes far too much energy to micromanage and ""fix"" them. Do not worry what people think/feel about you, instead use the emotions you do recognize to your advantage. The same goes for yourself as well.   tl;dr: keep it simple and be 100% genuine, let go.
Ex4: If there was one thing that has saved my ass plenty of times and has gotten me plenty of ass is that women **LOVE** Emotion. It’s like a drug to them, and Emotion should be Man’s main weapon in the war of the sexes. Emotions our are tits and ass. They even the playing field.  There is a constant complaint that women are too emotional, though this is the trait of women we should be most thankful for. Emotions are at the center of almost every significant action a woman takes. Why do Women have sex? If you say it’s because Women like to orgasm, then you are wrong. Only men are have sex for the sole reason of chasing a orgasm. Women have sex for **Validation**.   We simply need to look at a woman’s actions to see proof. Remember that one guy that sold drugs and was asshole to her all the time? What about that skinhead who was a part of a biker gang and beat the shit out of her? How about the older man who killed his first wife and burned his second wife, but is just misunderstood and was beaten by his father and he’s so confused? You know who you don’t hear about? The guy with a 9\-5 with a engineering degree who bought thousands of dollars worth of jewelry and showers her with love and affection.  Logically, we know which man would be a good choice for a woman. **But women don’t have sex based on logic**. It would be in your best interest to stay away from logic if you are trying to get a woman. One of the lessons I learned after learning the importance of Emotion is that if I’m trying to make sense of a woman’s actions, I’m in the wrong mindset. For Men, it makes sense that rich guys get pussy, therefore women like money. It’s a lot more confusing to think women only like the Emotions money can supply them with.  There are multiple directions I could take this with, and go with the familiar concepts of emotional rollercoasters and Push/Pull but I don’t want to diminish the boiled down concept.  When in doubt, always go back to giving a girl Emotion. As soon as you veer away from that, the sooner you will fuck up.

"
5,Work,"Ex1: I've been a member of this subreddit since about July. I've read many posts about women on the job trying to screw them out of jobs. I thought, ""This will never happen to me!"" Boy was I wrong.  I'm a college student, and assistant manager at a fitness and health store. I usually come in, get my work done, assign my staff work and finish out the day. The head manager is this woman who put/puts up a facade as if everything is A-OK. Before this instance, me and her always had a professional type of relationship, I know not to shit where i eat. She was off today and the General Manager was in town, doing store checkups. The chick manager comes in and her and the GM go to the back room. After about 20 minutes, I overheard the GM telling her it was no hard feelings and to turn in her key. She couldn't even looked at me and walked out the door.   I asked the GM what that was about, and he told me that she had been complaining about me a lot and was lobbying for me to get fired. She had a big problem with me apparently. I'm completely oblivious to all of this and genuinely surprised. He told me that she gave him an ultimatum, and he chose to keep me and let her walk.  Conclusions: Luckily me and the GM have a great personal as well as Business relationship. Don't for one second think this couldn't happen to you. I was oblivious that someone who was so nice and friendly was lobbying for me to get fired. AWALT on any level.  
Ex2: Shitty story.   So this meth-heads comes in to the store to buy a soda can, goes in the washroom looking suspicious as fuck and stays there for a good 30 minutes(All unbeknownst to me at this point and just a point of view from co-worker). This female co-worker of mine reports this to my manager who is also a woman. Manager calls me to check the bathroom and for sure the guy was doing some shady shit. I was told to stand and watch the guy, and before he came out, my manger tells my co-worker she has to be the one to confront this man. Co-worker says she’s scared, and I being a “macho-man” decide to step in: forgetting that it’s not my job but my manger. The man comes out the bathroom, eyes wide as fuck walking around and I confront him). I accuse him of stealing (it has been proved that he stole before) and he proves to me that he bought the can of soda by going to the register and showing me that the cashier rang him up. I felt so stupid and embarrassed. I worried afterwards, and the bitch co-worker says to not worry and she knows not to take me to war.   I learned a valuable lesson yesterday. If it’s not my job and I have nothing to gain, I must stay out of it. Furthermore, none of the other workers including my manger suffered consequences because the man came back, yelling at me in front of other customers. I feel salty but did not lose much because I don’t care about being promoted or having sex with any of them(temporary job). I guess I can keep learning valuable lessons from this place. 
Ex3: I've been having trouble bringing myself together lately since everyone i know is established in their careers and making close to 70k+.  I come from very ambitious driven background but made many poor decisions in college and after that resulted in me not having a job until i was much older, and a minimum wage one at that. In addition to not having a social life or being able to meet girls, I'm trying to land a job and build something where i can get a job, build a career and establish a nest egg. I'm fortunate to be supported by family but they won't be there for long.  I'm based in the bay area and need to enter a career that can be financially successful but i'm having trouble finding a path as I'm used to school where everything is defined. I feel every career path is locked out for me since I didn't take advantage of prestigious internships and jobs in college and don't have a high gpa.  Is there a field i can enter in something quick to get me out of my rut? I've already graduated college a long time ago and my degree isn't going to land me a job directly, what's a job i can go into and a clear path to get there and ensure financial success? I'm a person who's used to steps to reach a defined career, and i'm so used to college, i have a tough time navigating or entering the working world, there's plenty of tech companies around me but I don't know how to enter without a engineering background? Is there a post-bacc program i can enter, a master's program? What can i do in my area and in my situation?
Ex4: Imagine your regular cucked beta-male.  - He spends all his spare time on one women and gets very little in return.  - He refuses to move on because he feels she is the only thing he has.  - He doesn't have the balls to straight up make a move. Instead hoping that one day she will see all the good things he's doing and give him a reward.  Now just replace the women with a job. You are now looking at your average wage-cuck.    - He feels as if he can't get another job and is 'stuck' in the one he has.   - He is too afraid to ask for a raise, or legal wages, or to leave on time in case he gets fired.   - He feels his only chance of getting a raise is to suck up and work unpaid overtime.  Beta-males get fucked in their personal lives **and** their professional lives. Listen to some of these pathetic excuses!  &gt;Some people opt in to overtime due to a sort of covert insinuation, most places you can leave right on time but an arched eyebrow and a ""Hmm... leaving on time again... OK bye."". You don't know if doing it screws you out of favourable positions and promotions so you work overtime like a rube.  CUCK.  &gt;People can't just throw away their jobs, especially if others are relying on them having a stable income.  SAD.  &gt;**ME**: If you're unwilling to take on a little risk then you deserve your $11/hr. I confronted my employer on my very first pay check and raised my wage by 30%. All my coworkers are getting paid 90% - 25% of what I get because they're afraid to ask for more.   &gt;**CUCK**: Well you're one of the very lucky ones. Did Daddy get you your interview?  SALT.  Everything you learn about women here, applies to your professional career.   - You Need Abundance Mentality.  - Your Boss is lucky to have **you**  - A job is not something you put nice coins into and get ~~sex~~ promotions out of.  - You get what you're willing to ask for.  - MGTOW: If you don't like what's on offer, start your own business.  So how do you actually ensure you rock at your job. Again it's the same for women. 80/20 rules. Be the top 20% and you will have an amazing career. If you're not their yet, then pretend you are and work towards it. Game and muscles is replaced with networking skills and a portfolio.   You're up to speed on Women. You're getting enough sex to satisfy your needs and not sacrificing anything in return. Now it's time to focus on your money. Most of you already know this, however simply seeing the connections might help you remember them.  It goes without saying, that being an alpha-asshole douchebag is not a good idea in the work place. Whether you're entry level or the god damn CEO. Exude Value - you don't need to be a good employee, you just need to be good at getting shit done.  **TLDR**   Wage-Cucks and Beta Males are the same people. When it comes to jobs the comparison  to women is uncanny. Abundance Mentality. Don't be afraid to ask for more. Need to be willing to take risks. Don't sacrifice your principles. If you don't like it, MGTOW and start a business. Be the top 20%. If you're valuable you will make money in many different ways.
Ex5: A female co-worker that I’ve only worked with a few times “passed away” within the last month.  A big deal was made about her passing around the workplace so I figured that she was in some unfortunate accident and everyone wanted to pay respects.  Which is fine.    Another male co-worker I was working with this morning brought up the subject of her death on a whim and then proceeds to tell me that she was 49, suffered from depression, un-married with no children and living alone with cats.  I immediately know where that was going and my suspicions were correct...  He also proceeds to tell me that it was a suicide and that no one will admit it.  Apparently he was at her service and everyone knew but no one wanted to tell….  you could cut the tension with a knife.  She always put up this front at work (just like all these girls on facebook) of how happy go lucky she is and what a great life she has in and out of work.  It’s all bullshit.  Most of them probably cry themselves to sleep every night because they don’t have a man in their lives that values them as more than a fuckhole.  I don’t know how she took her life but she was in her apartment for 3 days before she was found by another co-worker who just happened to decide to check up on her.  Poor woman bought the bullshit that the sisterhood sold her about how you’ll be happier with your job than having a husband to take care of, raising children and taking care of a home.  Her and millions of other women in the west who’ve bought into this shit.  Feminism killed her.  No one will admit it, but deep down they all know it.  I just respond to my co-worker “that’s unfortunate” no way in hell could I go into any detail as he’s solid blue pill.  This is the first time that this has hit closest to me and it’s only going to get [worse](http://time.com/4547322/american-teens-anxious-depressed-overwhelmed/) boys.  You can’t tell these women any different becasue you'll be labeled a misogynist asshole.  They can’t be saved.  Women are going to start offing themselves in record numbers. I want to buy stock of whoever manufactures anti-depressants.  You can’t tell these women different and you can’t save them so you might as well make some money off their asses…..

Ex1: Summary: Flirting with a woman is like trying to hold intelligent conversation with a brick wall.  Topic level: Beginner  ***  T'is I, your evil Zionist overlord here to help you overcome the ineffectual emasculation training that the matriarchy has imprinted.  The idea of a shit test is a relic from the PUA days of TRP. The truth is that it is a terrible way to look at things and completely points you in the wrong direction. Test implies conscious thought on part of the woman with a specific goal in mind. We attribute to her the notion that she is testing us in order to determine alpha validity. My experience is that this is FALSE.  Accepting your own status as a dumbshit is important because you can quickly realize that the bitch you are gaming is a bigger dumbshit than you are. That's right. In my experience, she isn't shit-testing you. She is dumbshit who doesn't actually have anything productive or witty to say and is just spouting nonsense. The shit test is just her lying on her fucking back and expecting you to do all the work conversationally.  Shit test implies both agency and participation on behalf of the woman. Again, my experience is that this is false. She expects you to plan, execute, and pay for every single thing in a relationship while she just goes through the minimum effort half-assed motions. Is it so hard to believe she is exactly the same way conversationally?  So this brings us to the core of what is dumbshit game. It is the beginner level technique I practiced after realizing that people were dumbshits. How well could you carry on a conversation with a non-participating barely-literate dumbshit?  The answer is to pull her into your frame. Which is TRP speak for putting on a verbal puppet show for a bitch. You have your own brand, your own world, your own perspective and she is a passive tourist in it. She will, of course, test your frame. Some people will say that this is her way of accessing your alpha qualities. I disagree. That girl is a dumbshit that has been in dozens and dozens of relationships and failed every single one of them. She isn't testing you. She simply doesn't know how to properly behave within a relationship.  Back to the topic. You need to pull her into your world despite her dumbshit ways. For that, my default tool is the monologue. How well can you fillibuster a glorified blowup doll? (A fillibuster is when an American senator talks for hours to a sleeping congress in order to stall a vote). Few things are as useful as rehearsed sentences related to common topics that come up. You weren't just going out there without a fully drawn out identity, right?  You need to sell yourself and a simple Q&amp;A won't work. If you are thinking smalltalk, that doesn't work. Smalltalk is death. Pleasantries is bad. You need to up those tingles. You need to paint with a vivid brush the autistic masterpiece that is you. That is the core of dumbshit game, by dumbshits for dumbshits to be used on dumbshits.  So your homework is to defend yourself and sell yourself. Why have you become what that you are? Defend those parts of yourself and make it interesting. Be able to talk about  it and convincingly defend your position. Be entertaining and charming and witty. You need to show her that you have the muscles AND the brains. Write it down and practice it.  You will eventually have a large assortment of mini-monologues and a large assortment of little tricks. That takes time, effort, and practice.  These are topics that will come up anyway. Short responses won't work because she expects you to carry the entire conversation. Have that monologue prepared.  That is it for now. Happy Hanukah.  ***  TLDR: Monologues are useful tools in talking to bitches who barely participate except to throw out shit tests.
Ex2: I was browsing through ""Surely you're joking Mr. Feynman!"" and look what I found!   ""We went over to their table and he introduced me to the girls and then went off for a moment. A waitress came around and asked us what we wanted to drink. I ordered some water, and the girl next to me said, ""Is it all right, if I have a champagne?""  ""You can have whatever you want,"" I replied coolly, ""'cause you're payin' for it."" (Not putting her at a pedestal)  ""What's the matter with you?"" She says. ""Cheapskate, or something?"" (Shit test 1)  ""That's right."" (Holding frame)  ""You're certainly not a gentleman!"" she said, indignantly. (Shit test 2)  ""You figured me out immediately!"" I replied. (Agree and amplify)  I had learned in New Mexico many years before not to be a gentleman.    Pretty soon they were offering to buy me drinks - the tables were turned completely! ""  And these were prostitues in Vegas! Holy crap! What a cool scientist!  And of course, the red pill works.
Ex3: Long time lurker first time poster. Not sure If I did the flair right. But this is a FR. ------------------------------------------ Quick background: devoured the sidebar and hoping to contribute something worthwhile, and keep the blah blah in my post to a minimum. So me, in my 30's, STEM field, good finances, athletic, with a 24yr HB7, or 22/30 (on the Patrice O'neil scale) as a LTR prospect. Sorry If format is shit.  I introduce new activities to the bedroom from time to time. Usually the morning after the ""have you done this with another girl already?"" comes out. The last few times a single AA or phrase turning and subject change have handled it. Now it was up a level on her part. The other night, went to my garage and shagged on my motorbike.  (to understand the story i got a bit buzzed with a friend before i saw her). I was smiling and amused during the whole convo.  Girl: so do you do that often on your moto? Me: do what?  Girl: you know what.... Me: -stare then look away-  Girl: was that a first time? Me: Totally, I've never had you on my moto before  Girl: -scoff- have you been with someone else on your moto? Me: Oh yeah. it's great. you go faster downhills with someone on the back.  Girl: -head roll- have you had sex with another girl on your moto? Me: Oh yeah. But I was kinda high last night so now recalling whether it was my fantasy vs reality....it's all cloudy right now.  Girl: It's really difficult to get something concrete from you Me: I do agree that vanilla icecream is superior to chocolate  end of questioning.  During the day other shit tests that came unprovoked (and easily defeated) were: ""you know you're short for a guy"", ""you're not getting any younger"".  5 min after I passed those she tugs me out of public view for a makeout sesh.   I'm thinking if there is a next time and she goes up a level or even to nuclear or withhold sex. I figure a sprinkle of dreadgame should work well if it goes there, as if to say to her ""obviously I've done a lot before, that's why you're satisfied, but if you fuck with me I can obviously go off to where I was doing that before"". -------------------------------------------------------  *Shit tests never stop even when you are makin' them swoon.  *Shit tests can be fun  Obligatory thank you to TRP for improving my life.  Edit: tried to use line segment dividers as per rules, but it just made the font bigger. shit.
Ex4: FYI: I was originally gonna post this on a pick up sub but I think it really belongs here.   I've never had a shortage of interest from women, in fact all my friends (including the female ones) have always been shocked at how much attention I get. I've never really had the desire to hook up with tonnes of random girls, and have always preferred relationships, so I've rejected a bunch of girls in my life. Also I'm Indian so to the Indian guys out there who say they can't get laid, you're either in a pretty racist place (which does sometimes happen to be fair) or you're not happy with your life currently so aren't giving off positive vibes- I've had times where I haven't been happy and trust me the female attention I got was way less, but this was not to do with race.   One thing I've learnt from interacting with all these women is this- If a woman shit tests you constantly and makes things difficult, she is not worth YOUR time. If you're just looking for a one night stand then this is different, you can put in the effort to pass these tests and get laid, but if it's a relationship you're after and the girl you want is shit testing you constantly I would say move on. All women will shit test to some degree, but in my experience confident high value (better personality and looks) women who know they want a strong guy actually test less, are more choosy and better judges of character. So if they meet an alpha male, they can already pick up on his vibe and know he is strong. That's not to say they don't shit test at all, they definitely do, but not to the same level of these other low value, often mentally ill women. I have generally found the higher value women to be more fun and less bitchy.   Honestly I would say that if you are in contact with a girl and she is really making it that difficult for you then you should just find someone else. Even if you think the girl really likes you but is hiding it, this is not the kind of girl you should want to be with because she will make your life miserable. Also, chances are that if she really likes you but is testing you this heavily it's because she has been fucked over a lot in the past and is now damaged as a result. She'll also be more likely to cheat. Steer clear.   A lot of pick up guys will always talk about passing shit tests, and this is right for the initial approach and if you wanna get laid, but if she is still testing thq fuck out of you well into your relationship then either you're being a little bitch or she is mentally ill (probably the latter tbh).   Anyway that's just my two cents, I think it's advice worth taking.

------------------------------

Ex1: Can someone define the term **charming behaviour**? Everyone keeps telling that it is a vital point to have it, yet there are contradictory definitions of what it is. For example a lot of people are recommending *How to win friends and influence people*, on the other hand, some RP guys are saying that it only teaches you to be a beta with women and you need a different type of approach with them. What is the difference then? Should you have a different type of charm toward friends, collegues, strangers compared to girls you want to pick up? Can you provide some examples, like movie characters, video clips of what charming behaviour looks like? And finally, can you recommend some books to read about it, which you found useful in the subject?
Ex2: So far, every therapist I used to see show little to no masculinity, and if you think about it caring for others, telling people what you think they want to hear, and therapy are all feminine traits. I told my last therapist I was reading ""The Way of Man"" by Jack Donovan and he disagreed with most of the book. That's when it struck me: ""All therapists are blue pilled"". I later ended our sessions and moved on with my life. Instead of seeing a therapist, I'll lift, meditate, eat better, and talk to women, merely hanging out with them. (Tao of Steve)  Lessons Learned:  A therapist won't make you masculine. You have to do that on your own.  Take care of yourself. Eat better, workout, and meditate and surround yourself with good friends. If you don't have good friends, go find some. Go anywhere. Just make connections. That alone will help you feel much better than 50 therapy sessions.
Ex3: I posted this list as a comment some time ago. I referenced it a few times, but I always thought I'd need to expand it and make it into a post, for better referencing.  There are plenty of good TRP-themed books to read, but no official list. There are a few (good) posts with (lots of) recommended books but they're a large menu à la carte. Here's my personal fine-cuisine full course **for the newly unplugging**. Short, tasty, and **to be consumed in the right order**.  ---  ## Hors d'oeuvre  The couple of very best ""mainstream-friendly"" books on the importance of masculinity, to start gently and arouse curiosity:  * 1- ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"", by Robert Glover  * 2- ""The Way of The Superior Man"", by David Deida  ## Entrées  Which should hopefully be enough to pave the way for the upcoming shock of unplugging that comes when you swallow the red pill bible:  * 3- ""The Rational Male"", by Rollo Tomassi  * 4- ""The Rational Male Preventive Medicine"", by Rollo Tomassi  (Note: Rollo now has a third book out, which is just as good, and reads better, but the basics are in the first two and remember this list is about efficient unplugging so let's carry on..)  ## Main  Once aware that everything he knew about the world of humans' interactions was a lie, our unplugged man will then find the best general information on how to deal with Men and Women in the Real World in:  * 5- ""The 48 Laws of Power"", by Robert Greene  * 6- ""Practical Female Psychology For the Practical Man"", by Joseph South, David Clare and Franco  ## Dessert  And only then, when our red-pill-aware man finally understands the theory on the real nature of women and of human interactions, he might want to read the best books that put that theory into practice to game and bang women:  * 7- ""Bang"" and ""Day bang"", by Roosh V  * 8- ""Sex God Method"", by Daniel Rose   ## Coffee and cigars  With his eyes finally open and his sexual lust quenched temporarily, the newly unplugged man may feel at loss in this scary but very real world. He will need to redefine himself and his place in it. I then recommend:  * 9- ""Meditations"", by Marcus Aurelius  * 10- ""The Way of Men"", by Jack Donovan  ---  Knowledge is Power. Sharpen your understanding of red pill wisdom to maximize the results that actions (lifting and approaching) already started giving you. A post on this sub's daily feed with a score under 100 is guaranteed to contain less wisdom than a book deemed vital to read by the red pill community. Your daily time allowance for absorbing information is limited. Prioritize your reading.  
Ex4: Everybody knows we're hip, which is why we use hashtags. And today's hashtag is the [#BookShelfChallenge](https://www.trp.red/feed/hashtag/BookShelfChallenge).  A common question we get in modmail as well as on askTRP is what books are worth reading? What books helped shape the men before us into the men we would like to become? What books provide good insight into the world, or elucidate a point that is otherwise misunderstood by the masses?  So today we have the [#BookShelfChallenge](https://www.trp.red/feed/hashtag/BookShelfChallenge). Post a picture or list of the books on your shelf that you think are quality reads that others should check out. Or just post a bunch of pretentious philosophy books so you can bathe in your superiority while you stroke your dick to your own reflection in the mirror while listening to Kant audio books.  #[GAYLUBEOIL DID IT.](https://www.trp.red/feed/status/11436)  #[I DID IT.](https://www.trp.red/feed/status/11440)  Now it's your turn.  ---- As an aside, one of my books is written by one of our own (/u/adam-l) and I highly recommend it: **The Empress is Naked** - [You can read my review here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3w3iu3/the_empress_is_naked/) (I have no affiliation with Adam, other than to say he's a prolific author and I always like a chance to promote our genuine content creators.)

Ex1: **Disclaimer**   &amp;nbsp;  *The article is 2 years old so this may have been posted before, but I just found it.*  &amp;nbsp;  **tl dr**  Bloopers will shame you for not having homosexual sex.  &amp;nbsp;  **Intro**  Bloopers engaged in total war for your mind. My theory is that they will try to fill your brain with so much cognitive dissonance that you literally cannot tell left from right, right from wrong, male from female. The newest shaming tactic will be that it is *gay* for straight males to **not** suck dick. They live in some alternate bizzaro dimension of reality.  &amp;nbsp;  **Body**  [Archive.is: Mirror.uk, Transgender girl says she is rejected by straight guys for 'having male parts'](http://archive.is/2wMK3)  **Yeah, no shit** straight guys don't find males attractive. But I imagine they will be teaching that this is homophobia or make it part of ""diversity training"" in sex ed class.  &gt; The doc shows the moment Claire, from Virginia, meets a guy that she likes, only to be rejected by him as soon as he finds out she was born a boy.  Natural reaction.  &gt; The boys, who were originally attracted to Claire, did not call after finding out that she is trans. ""That's it, silence,"" says Claire. ""Like nothing from them again.""  Guess normies haven't gone full cuck yet.  &gt; ""Straight guys just can't get over you having the male parts.  *For real, girlfriend?!*  &gt; They hang out together, see friends and go to the movies, but their love is one in a million - Arin was born a girl and Katie was born a boy. They are both transgender.  LMAO... WTF... They both switched genders, so are they straight again?  &gt; emotional rollercoaster of what it is to be transgender, from the lows of bullying, abuse and suicide attempts to their joy as they undergo hormone treatments and surgery.  Sounds healthy.  &amp;nbsp;  **Lessons Learned**  * Discard the BluePill propaganda like your life depends on it. * Teach your sons and daughters to reject blooper shaming tactics. * The way the enemy works is to slowly normalize degenerate behavior until, after some generations, they are fucking you in the ass. Literally. 
Ex2: From Fox News:   [Male Backlash Against Metoo is Brewing](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/02/04/male-backlash-against-metoo-is-brewing.html)  &gt;Men are scared, and feminists are delighted. But the urge to call out and punish male sexual transgression is bound to clash with an inescapable truth: We’re all in this together, men and women.  Read carefully.  Men being ""scared"" is fine until it affects......women!  &gt;Female staffers and lobbyists have found “many male legislators will no longer meet with them privately,” reported The Miami Herald. “I had a senator say, ‘I need my aide here in the room because I need a chaperone,’ ” lobbyist Jennifer Green told the paper. “I said, ‘Senator, why do you need a chaperone? . . . Do you feel uncomfortable around me?’ ‘Well,’ he said, ‘anyone can say anything with the door shut.’ ”  Oh No!  Women are being affected by the whole Metoo thing.  It is time to back off!  We are all in this together don't ya know.  Men and women, together.  Forever.  LMFAO.  &gt;“I’m getting the feeling that we’re going back 20 years as female professionals,” said Green, who owns her company. “I fully anticipate I’m going to be competing with another firm that is currently owned by some male, and the deciding factor is going to be: ‘You don’t want to hire a female lobbying firm in this environment.’ ”  HAHHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAHH!!!!!!!  Do you mean that extreme actions beget extreme reactions?  Who knew?  &gt;This kind of thinking is catching on in aggressively P.C. Silicon Valley, where men are taking to message boards like Reddit to express interest in sex segregation — sometimes labeled “Men Going Their Own Way,” or the “Man-o-Sphere.”   Yah!  She said it.  So what is important about MGTOW and the Manosphere?  &gt;How will that work out for women in the tech industry, where they already face substantial challenges?  Of course.  My guess is not good.  The Pence rule, as advocated by none other than the professor, is now in full force and effect.  Men are not stupid and we are not going to be put into helpless situations where 'anybody can say anything' BUT women are to be believed.  Nope!  &gt;Several major companies have told us they are now limiting travel between the genders  Yes they are.  But don't forget what is important.  How is all this going to affect THE WOMEN!  &gt;If men start to back away from women, at least in professional settings, it’s difficult to see how that will aid the feminist cause.  Oh, so not good huh.  Maybe this Metoo thing wasn't such a good idea.  Maybe going for the jugular and total supremacy was a bridge to far?  Of course none of that matters.  The important thing is how it affects the women.  Got it.  Goddesses must be comfortable.  KK.    Wait, what happens if we decide to MAKE THEM A BIT UNCOMFORTABLE? Maybe something happens?  Who knows.  &gt;be wary of unintended consequences. Turning men and women into hostile opposing camps is not going to be good for either sex.  We are WAY past that point broh.  Way past it.
Ex3: Kitten is still struggling to come to terms with having to share my attention with FunSize, not to mention the occasional plate. FunSize, of course, is experienced at this, and has no issues, but Kitten feels threatened by her very presence, and won't talk to her for long enough to bond and stop seeing her as a threat.  Since Kitten is actually Dr. Kitten, PhD, she likes to intellectualize things that upset her, thinking about them in abstract terms rather than as they relate to her personally. This gives her emotional distance so she can cope. So the other day (I actually started writing this sometime back, so it was a while ago now), she hits me with this question:  ""How does polygamy [by which she means polygyny] fit into evo psych? How did monogamy [by which she means monogyny] form?""  Fleshing out the gist of my answer into a compete description for TRP:  **Polygyny** is a mating strategy optimized for replacing combat losses, because one man can easily keep multiple women pregnant. It's used by warlike societies, or those with high male-specific mortality rates.  **Monogyny** is a mating strategy optimized for appeasing low-tier males, because it guarantees them a mate. It's used by peaceful societies which depend on beta male labour and cooperation for their prosperity.  *Polygyny's effect upon the Sexual Marketplace is to increase the availability of apex males.*  This benefits:  [Read the rest on trp.red...](https://www.trp.red/p/whisper/726)

Ex1: Summary: this is what happens when woman go unchecked for decades.  Body: here we are in 2016. There is a popular hash tag on twitter that isn't in the slightest bit trying to be ambiguous. I applaud that. It's open. It's relevant. Transparency at its finest. #wastehistime2016 has got to be a victory lap for woman for all the orbiters they have in their arsenal.   For those too lazy for twitter I'll give you some highlights.   Hang out with him all day and then when you get home tweet, ""damn today was hella boring"" #WasteHisTime2016.  Wait until he catches feelings and then ask him if his best friend is single #WasteHisTime2016  Tell him to come over then fall asleep &amp; don't answer the ""I'm here"" text #wastehistime2016  Ask him if he is good with his hands, then when he comes over make him put together that IKEA furniture. #WasteHisTime2016  Tweet about how you have no one texting you and when he texts you don't reply #WasteHisTime2016   Just an absolute frontal assult on common decency. Here it is gentlemen, the emphatical proof that: Yes they know what they're doing and No they don't give a fiddlers fuck!   Am I suggesting that men should expect to get laid or be entitled to such after they  build some broads IKEA table? No! But it's just plain silly to not see that the woman of today know exactly what they're doing. Manipulation has always been the tool of the fairer sex. They're predisposed to it. That's Biology. But to be so upfront with that power is so disrespectful. And the worst part is betas will continually get trapped or propositioned into shit like this. I'm honestly surprised that there aren't more guys in this sub after seeing this shit.  I'm not as angry as I once was but I'm more shocked and surprised. Sure I think most of us knew woman who put you into these convenient situations did so with intent. I'm just shocked they're so open about it.   Imagine if the Chad's of the world put on a show like this? Picture the reactions of them.  Summary: kill any doubt about her being naive. She's not fucking naive she knows exactly what she's doing. The benefit of the doubt is reserved for something that has doubt.  
Ex2: Hey, i thought I'd left for good but I can't force the purple or blue pill down again after learning the truth about female nature ! I see it all around me every fucking day and i cannot unlearn what I've been taught. Twotter is trending the #womenshistorymonth thing right now and its all bullshit ! Really a MONTH !!! women take credit for all the achievements man has made they even had the audacity to post about women in the second world war making scraps of metal and working in the workforce at the time, newsflash the 40s are over and what do the men of the greatest generation leave to the rest of us today !? Women who ride the cock carousel! They fought and died for what ?so that women can bitch about problems that no longer exist ! Its disgusting and I encourage anyone with a twitter  and get on and use the hashtag to spread the truth about female nature ! Ive spammed several links to both this sub Reddit and other MGTOW articles.

This came up on my FB because a friend commented on it. I read the headline &amp; instantly though, ""nah, thanks, I'm good, sounds like a bad time to me."" Then I actually clicked on the article and I laughed even harder when I read that this took place in the town I grew up in: Ojai, California.   Reflecting back on growing up in Ojai there is a lot to be grateful for, but over the last few years it's really been overrun by hyper-liberal mentalities &amp; has become sort of a hot-spot weekend vacation town for the Hollywood/Santa Monica wealthy yuppies. I actually moved away to Boise, ID when I was 20 years old, back in '05. I spent the following 10 years in Boise, but after I split with my chick I got a bit homesick &amp; moved back to Ojai. At first, I was excited to be back around my family, but after about 2 years I grew tired of the pussy-whipped liberal bullshit &amp; unreasonable housing costs &amp; just moved back here to Boise 3 months ago and feel like I'm in the company of good people. But seeing this article and finding out that it took place in Ojai was not shocking in the least, but a huge reaffirmation that moving away from that area was the right move on my part.   &amp;#x200B;  That article is a crock of shit.

"
6,Family,"Ex1: TL;DR: Got in a car accident, AWALT.  Here's a rant for you, got in a wreck with a woman. Naturally she is lacking in accountability, responsibility, dignity, and self awareness. I'll try and keep it brief.  I was driving down a busy rural highway yesterday. I see an old Chevy Cavalier trying to make a right and join the traffic, so I move to the left lane to make room. The little Chevy pulls out, crosses two lanes and slams into the side of my truck.  I pull to the shoulder and sit in there for a minute to compose myself before engaging the other driver. I've been in this situation a few times and have learned how to handle it.  The other driver gets out, its a woman. Oh shit. I make no comments, just ask for her insurance information. She refuses and responds with ""My car isn't really damaged so we can just go. It was your fault anyway."" (Why are women so fucking self centered?) I respond by silently pulling out my phone and calling the sheriff department.   As I am wading through the bureaucratic cesspool that is American law enforcement, I see two kids get out of the back seat.   So the cops come, they separate us and listen to our stories. As I am telling my side, I see her being detained. Fuck! (in my state, if you don't have insurance they don't let you drive.) She starts screaming, crying, cursing, using every tool in her emotional manipulation toolbox to get out of this situation while the kids witness her breakdown. But one of the cops is a woman and she ain't fallin' for that shit.   So, this woman is driving recklessly, with two kids in the car, without insurance, and an utter lack of self awareness.   Now I have to pay to get my truck fixed, unless I want to sue her, and her kids get to see what an emotional, selfish wreck their mother is.   After giving my statement I drive off with the crazy bitch in my rear view, still making a scene and her kids still watching and the cops still not giving a shit.  Im no parent but there are kids in my family and I adore them. When I drive with them I am the absolute model of the defensive driver. What the fuck is she thinking?! Risk your own life if you like, but what about the children! Cunts like this make me livid.  Lessons learned:  Keep money in your bank account Keep calm in bad situations Keep your insurance up to date Keep away from single mothers in shitty old cars  Be safe out there, brothers.   
Ex2: I joined this place late 2015. The idea of a LTR/marriage was mocked back then, and rightly so. Now we keep seeing posts about ""girlfriends"" instead of ""plates"" and even users advocating for marriage. There is even a flair for LTR. I'm not going to discuss marriage, if you really don't get it by now I don't know what to tell you.   LTRs are like marriage, without the legal aspects. You won't get divorce raped, but you're still a beta. Ask yourself, why would a reasonable man ever commit to a woman? Historically, men did this in order to start a family. They provide for the woman and in return they get children and a woman who submits to them.  The problem today is, the west is not a place to start a family. You can not have children, they belong to the mother. Even if they don't get taken from you, you are not allowed to raise your kids the way you want. You can't spank them, because you risk loosing them and this pussified society will lock you up for ""child abuse"".   So if you do not want kids, why commit to a woman? Give me one good reason...You can fuck her and even date her if you like, without committing. A man who was swallowed the pill seeks plates, he would never restrict himself to a single woman.  Committing, in hopes of a romantic LTR, is what a weak man does. If you are dead set on having a wife and kids, then MOVE.
Ex3: I had the misfortune of seeing yet another CNN special on ""Human Trafficking"" and, once again, the bias and misinformation triggered me.  THIS is the definition of ""slavery"":  &gt;A relationship characterized by coercive control and a loss of freedom of movement such that the person is not able to freely move about and/or is unable to leave their employment.  So according to the SJW lying fucks we have THREE elements of a ""slave"":""  1.  Subject to coercive control  2.  Unable to move about freely  3.  Unable to leave their employment  As soon as I saw the definition flashed on the screen I recognized it immediately as **a TYPICAL divorce for men.**  1.  Coercive control:  Men are subject to the coercive control of an emotional terrorist in the home.  In a divorce the woman will use the children, she will lie about sexual assault, she will withhold the children from the man, she will alienate the man from his friends and even his family.  This is the essence of coercive control!  If her power slips in any way, she can call in the White Knights in Blue with big guns, small dicks, and billy clubs to pummel her husband into submission, chain him up, and throw him in a dark cell where we laugh with great delight about his risk of being a victim of sexual assault.  I have seen MORE THAN ONE woman taunt her husband as he was being taken to jail for non payment of support:  ""Don't bend over to pick up the soap.""  Even the female judge smiled.    2.  Unable to move about freely:  A man with children in divorce is NOT free to move.  He is not free to take his kids to the park.  He is not free to find a better place to live.  A man with children is literally held hostage by the woman.  Eshar Villar talks about children as adorable but that women use them as ""hostages"" and it is 100% true.    Divorced men almost never get custody so if they wish to see their kids they are literally held prisoner in the location where the wife decides they are going to live.  The husband has almost no say whatsoever.  I have seen SEVERAL cases where the man is trying to see the kids and the wife continually thwarts his visitation.  Nothing is done no matter how much money the man spends on motions and lawyers.    Then a couple months later (after the husbands motion to enforce visitation is denied or delayed and deferred) the woman comes in with a motion to change domicile. The man argues that she just wants to move to a different State so she can take the kids away from the father and move in with a thug boyfriend who has a record of child rape.  The man almost always loses no matter what evidence is produced.  The kids go wherever mom decides no matter how bad it is for the dad because THE DAD DOESN'T MATTER.  ONLY THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE ~~CHILDREN~~ WOMAN MATTERS.  * 3.  Unable to leave employment:  I worked at a legal aid clinic for a year and represented men thrown in jail for nonpayment of support almost every day.  These were men who lost jobs or were fired.  They looked for work and could not find it.  None of the reality mattered.  All that mattered was they owed a woman money.  The State enforced this at the point of a gun.    No man is free to leave his employment once his wife files for divorce else he be thrown in jail for nonpayment of support.  Then while in jail, he obviously can't make any money but the amount owed continues to go up.  None of that matters.  The State WILL force you to pay at the point of a gun and under threat of being reduced to chains.  They whine almost every week on CNN about the so called 40 million human ""slaves"" that are victims of ""trafficking.""  Of course this only counts women.  If we count the REAL slaves in the world, the figure is closer to 2 billion.  Don't expect to see any CNN stories on the plight of REAL oppression in the world today.

Ex1: I'm a 16 year old guy in high school in America. Today my mother yelled at my dad for not finding the time to talk to her parents. My dad is an introverted, passive guy as he was raised in a female dominated household. Things went shitty and she threw a fucking toaster at my dad and it hit his face. I intervened and yelled at her (big mistake. should have minded my own business).   She grabs me and started repeatedly slapping the shit out of me. She's 5'7 and I'm 6'2, and a lot stronger than her. I have been reading TRP for almost 6 months and knew better than to hit a woman no matter how batshit crazy she is. I pushed her away to defend myself (another mistake?). She trips and falls down. She now says that my dad and I abused and her and will call the cops on us. My beta dad will not get a divorce because it is taboo in our culture, or is probably ""in love with her"" or whatever I don't know. Fortunately, she did not call the cops, but this is not the first time this has happened.  How do I respond if the cops show up the next time? My dad does not understand that the justice system is in the favor of the woman and men will most often be seen as the aggressor. Things like these have completely put me off of marriage and relationships with women. I feel I'm slipping back into anger phase.
Ex2: Coming from my great state of Iowa:  ""Joe Vandusen, 45, received a letter earlier this month from the Iowa Department of Human Services notifying him that he would be required to pay child support for his estranged wife's child, even though he is not the father......Vandusen contacted the Department of Human Services' Child Support Recovery Unit to say he's not the biological father of his wife's child, and he offered to take a paternity test to prove it — but he was told it didn't matter, according to state law, he said""  DON'T GET MARRIED  Article:http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2016/03/25/man-contests-support-child-he-says-he-didnt-father/82282038/
Ex3: A quick story and a lesson.   I've already made a post about my father, who is a spineless beta, so I'll bring you up to speed. He married either a pretty good manipulator or a complete psychopath that was my mother. They had no sex beyond my birth. I mean NONE. He had a stack of pornos that was at least a foot and a half tall. He was forced to sleep on the couch in the basement. She would restrict his time spent with me. I'm pretty sure we only spent time together as a family on my birthday. Sometimes not even then.  Fast forward to  2013. She got divorced and petitioned the court to allow him 30 visits a year. 30 fucking visits. Of course she played the ""abused wife"", so she won and I now see him 2 times a month. She even wanted me to testify that he ""emotionally abused us"", exact words.  I'm pushing for more, which sends her into a rage or a sympathy fit (the crying and ""how could you do this to me?"" routine).  So here we are in 2016. In the last week alone, she's asked ""who are you trying to impress?"" when I came home with new clothes, put every obstacle possible in the way of my lifting, brought home 90% shit food when I told her to get protein and vegetables, and tried her usual ""he abused us"".  To top it off, she said ""I'm different"" when I hang out with my friends, and tried to get me to stop social interaction. She has none herself and it's probably the crab in the bucket mentality. I just told her to fuck off and then did my thing.   What can be learned from this? AWALT. Get a tattoo of it if you have to. I don't care if it's your own mother(Ive seen shit tons of females pull something similar), ALL FUCKING WOMEN ARE LIKE THAT. They'll try to drag you down and make you a beta. The best thing to do is just remove yourself and cut contact (which I've been doing for the past 4 or 5 years. I plan to move out at 18). They'll cry and scream, but you won't be a part of it. Don't give them validation.    If you have any tips besides telling her to fuck off, I'd be glad to hear them.
Ex4: I see the advice around here a lot about never get married. That's great advice. But then I see people saying they want to have children. Sorry guys, but this is not in your cards.  Never get married. Everyone knows the problem there. Women are 70% likely to divorce you and take half your net worth with them, and force you to give them free shit for a few years afterward. This is bad.  But if you have a kid with a woman, even if you don't get married, you're in a far worse spot than that. If you fail to make child support payments, you **go to prison.** Let that sink in for a bit fellows.  If you have a child with a woman, you are her indentured servant. Not for 7 years. For 18 years. Oh wait, unless your precious love child decides to go to college.  Did you know that when your child reaches the Age of Majority (usually 18), if you want to stop making child support payments, you have to go to court to ask the judge to kindly let you stop making payments? And the judge can say no. You can end up paying child support for many more years. I am not sure if there really is a cut-off, though practically it's usually 22-24.  So your love child is a bare minimum 18-year indentured servitude, with another 4-??? years depending on the whims of a judge when you decide you want to stop paying.  NEVER. EVER. HAVE. CHILDREN.
Ex5: I am the product of two incredibly strong male role models. I am also a formerly obese man who was an incel for roughly five years of my life. Someone looking at my example might think that those men failed me somehow, or that I was just a born loser. Neither of those things are true. The truth is that the world we live in now has changed, and I applied lessons that no longer have any validity while ignoring others that did because I grew up safe and sheltered from the harsher truths.  My grandfather was a WW2 navy pilot in the Pacific Theater. He married a beautiful woman and lived with her for 50+ years before his death. His daughter, my mother, married a young government man at age 18 and they are still together today. In theory, this foundation should have meant that I too would have a healthy marriage and a stable family. That was definitely not the case. Looking at my father and grandfather as behavioral examples, I dated women from 18 to 25 looking for a lifetime companion. I wanted someone who would be a great mother and a faithful wife. The women in my family are educated and outspoken, so I had no illusions about wanting some kind of demure housewife.  As you guys have probably predicted, this pursuit went HORRIBLY. I got laid a lot in college, but none of those ""relationships"" turned into anything. The few times I found women I loved turned into twisted episodes of oneitis that left me shaken and disturbed. When they were done playing with me and moved on to other guys, I couldn't understand what went wrong. I was trying my hardest to be kind and understanding, chivalrous, and generous. I was patterning myself after men that I saw as above reproach. What was wrong?  The elders on this forum all know why I failed. I failed because those two men are from another world than me. They're from a world before hypergamy, before the axiom of AF/BB. Expecting my life to proceed along the same lines as theirs was a miscalculation on my part, not theirs. I did not adopt the techniques that successful men around me were using because I thought they were ""assholes."" I didn't understand the psychology of the modern women because I thought it was ""sexist"". I did everything I could to ignore the impotence of my approach until eventually the sex dried up and I became a fat beta, orbiting a few women that I still imagined would be great wife material (ha ha). That would have been the story of my life: ""Fat guy does nothing. News at 11."" And all because I held onto outdated social constructs that made me feel good about myself.  So now I have TRP to thank for filling in what my father and grandfather could never have known to teach me. The other reason I posted this, though, is to say that there is still plenty to learn from your elders. My father and grandfather ALWAYS kept frame. When life was tough, they never let their wife or kids know. They didn't suffer insult, but they weren't fucking dicks always looking for a fight. They were cool guys, and strong men. They just weren't what I needed to be to survive in todays world. Let's make sure that when we look to the past we are carrying forward those traits which made those old guys so fucking cool, but don't forget that this isn't 1944, it's not 1978, it's now. You will adapt, or you will die fat and alone. I'm not saying this to be cruel (quite the opposite). I hope I can reach that one ""nice guy"" who hasn't heard this yet and let him know he can still be a great man, but being a nice man won't cut it anymore.

------------------------------

Ex1: Now by 'bone I don't mean REAL skeletons or corpses per se. And yeah, I'm using the term 'dysphemistically'. Here the 'bone' refers to a past 'dead' episode, a comment or details. And you use these bones in a mind game to trip up a woman, to contradict her--usually to defend yourself, but often to 'win' and control the current real-time space. Often you don't have to do any hard collecting because women often provide the 'bones' themselves  with what they've said or done before, BUT forgotten about.  But here's my classic example: My 'wife' does a lot of housework and lets me know, so one day I watched over what she actually did. Then I looked for the areas she'd missed, nothing came to mind but I stored it in my mind to find something; to 'look for bones'--then one day as I was preparing a meal I realised that the knives were blunt. In fact they were ALWAYS blunt and I could never remember her (or me) sharpening them. OK, that was one bone. Then I remembered that the light in our dining room didn't work properly either. We'd never noticed because we never used it. The room was an offshoot of the kitchen which provided a strong bright light. OK, that was the second bone. Now I didn't bring either of these matters up with my wife. I stored them, kept them secret, and waited. Then eventually it happened--out of the blue--I was relaxing after a heavy week away at work. I'd returned, first day off and was relaxing on the couch. Strange during these times the wife seemed to be at a frenzy cleaning. Why couldn't it occur BEFORE I got home? Then my wife 'reminded' me how lucky I was. That I could just relax because SHE did all the work around the house, and kept everything shipshape. SHIPSHAPE. That was my cue...""How come everything is shipshape when we haven't got a sharp knife in the house and the Dining light hasn't worked for years,"" I said. It worked a treat. She mumbled something and walked over to the knife set. Within 10 minutes I heard her furiously sharpening one of the blunt carving knives. I had dominated the space--with pure good common reason, evidence and a valid argument. Like a lawyer I picked my moment to present my 'exhibits'--the bones that I'd collected. And I was 'King' for a day.
Ex2: I was at the dear lease and a similar aged cousin and I had some whiskey and talked long into the night.  Sex came up and I have been with my wife for almost 15 years and I have been tracking it for the past 2 out of curiosity.  I showed him the frequency of our love life after being together for so long as we average 22.8 sessions a month.  After I told him my thoughts and philosophy he told me about Red Pill.  She is my second wife and my first wife treated me to a dead bedroom and took advantage of a young feminist raised man.  Once I got divorced it shook me to my core and changed the way I am with everyone but particularly with women.  1.  I am me and I honestly don't care of you don't like it.  I am loud and what comes up in my head comes out of my mouth.  I am very much a take me for who I am or leave me type of person.  2.  I have hobbies outside of my relationship.  I enjoy hiking, golfing, hanging out with other male friends and I do that without her and without her permission.  I will let her know what I am doing as a courtesy.  3. I lift heavy shit twice a week.  I overhead press 185, bench 315, squat 340 so I am stronger than most.  My wife likes my strength and likes how I am stronger than most. This is known by how she touches me and feels me up.  I lift for me and not for any other reason than to not be a weak ass pussy.  4.  I let my lust be known to my wife.  I am an alpha and I let it be known to her that she turns me on and I have needs.  I don't give two shit's is she is initiating or not......I do 90% of it and am quite fine with that.  If I was to wait for her to do it we would go down to 2-3 times a month.  I hit on her, slap her ass, fondle her, as she is mine.    5. She knows my expectations in the bedroom over frequency etc.  So if she isn't up to the task there are alternatives to PiV and she uses them on me.....not in a get it over way......in a ""see how much I can blow the socks of my husband"" way.  So nights where she isn't in the mood are quit ok with me.  6.  If there is an honest rejection I don't wine about it or beg or anything.  She respects me and I respect her and I know she is not blowing smoke up my ass.  If she says tomorrow......it will happen tomorrow.  7.  I clean the kitchen......that is all I do.  I don't even know how the vacuum works.  I am the primary earner so I don't do much around the house at all.  These are not rules I live by but observations on what makes me different from other ""men"". All I know is I have more sex than any one else in my social circle and I honestly think this is why.
Ex3: I know this subject is brought up on this sub literally every day, so I might be beating a dead horse but something happened recently to a family friend that I want to share. My dad's best friend's wife recently left him. This guy is one of the most alpha men I have ever met, a real old school badass that never took shit off anyone, male or female. And always had his shit together, everything he owned was paid for in cash.    Just for some background, he and his wife just celebrated their thirtieth anniversary in January, that's right, thirty years. They have two kids that are in their 20's.  He's drove a truck nearly all his life, usually local but occasionally over the road here and there.   Two weeks ago he accepted a run that took him about a week to complete. When he got home he said his wife was unusually quiet. He asked her if she felt ok and she told him that she had enjoyed him not being there for the past week, she didn't love him anymore and that she would be moving to her sister's house the next morning. Just like that, no discussions, no tears. His wife had accepted a clerical job at an attorneys office about six months beforehand and it recently came to light she was fucking the owner of the firm.    My point is this, you can be the most alpha guy around, work your ass off, have your shit together, marry a women that you love, buy a house, have children, stay together thirty years... but if she gets tingles for a lawyer that drives a new Porsche and you're blue collar, she's gone, along with at least half your shit.    I'm not one of these guys that are going to tell you never to get married, I myself am engaged. Just remember the prenup and never get too attached because AWALT. 
Ex4: I just had to share this, as usually we hear the opposite  I was listening to LBC (Leading Britains Conversation) earlier today, and it was discussing a recent divorce story of a man who was cheating on his wife, the wife files for divorce, the high court orders her to give £2MILLION to the 'Husband' to settle the divorce! The wife earned over £10m in bonuses over their 4 years of the relationship. No children involved.  I find this astonishing, I see so many horror stories on here about how the man gets divorce raped for everything he has but this seems to be one of those rare cases where the tables were dramatically turned  Of course, there was a massive outrage about this, with people saying how it isn't fair and blah blah blah, but if this was the other way around, it would not have even been mentioned. We all know the score.  This guy is the luckiest man alive. Gets out of his shit marriage, has another plate on the go (perhaps multiple) and now has £2MILLION extra to his name for it  Madness!  I guess the divorce rape situation can (sometimes) swing both ways.   I'm grateful I've found this sub at a young age, and i know never to get married, which is the moral of this story yet again. But perhaps for women with lots of wealth, maybe they shouldn't either as she obviously made a costly mistake here  Thoughts

7,Sex / Porn,"Ex1: Franklin Veaux is a sex and manosphere sage perhaps best known for his polyamory blog and book, *More than Two.*  There are volumes of reading on his site, but I wanted to call your attention to his sexual infographics.  These are richly detailed and intelligently organized; they are both useful and FUN.  Probably best to view on a large screen if possible.  [**Map of Human Sexuality**](https://www.xeromag.com/sexualinformatics/sexmap.gif)   Note the ""Land of Mundania"" is depicted as a smallish island at the lower left.

Ex2: I think it's funny that an escort that's sucked me off at least half a dozen times over the last two months hasn't had sex with the man she lives with for the last 6 months and now she's breaking up with him. When I asked her why she did it she said she wasn't happy and holding out on sex was her way expressing her dissatisfaction and that after giving him countless opportunities to fix whatever the issue was she decided to move on.   This dude even tried to kill himself when she told him they were breaking up. He doesn't want her sleeping at any ""friends"" place until she moves out so right now they still live in the same house even though they are separated. I think he's trying to win her back. Some divorced rich client who she's apparently in love with is renting an apartment for her and she'll be moving out the moment that comes through. It really sucks to be that dude. He doesn't know she's an escort on the side. I wonder how he'd feel if he knew his beloved is a cum guzzling hooker.   The levels of manipulation and deceit of this young 20 something year old is startling. 
""Behind every beautiful woman, there's a guy who's tired of fucking her""  Happened to me with a few of my exes - a few of them I broke up with, the others - ""slow fade"".   Every time I slowly faded, the woman would usually bombard my phone with texts, calls, video messages of herself crying ""please just say something, tell me you hate me, anything!"".  I'm not proud of it. The women I faded on, were usually those who I couldn't care less about, they were ""rebounds"" or ONS who fell into my arms fully knowingly of what was bound to happen.   I'd like to point out to an article that I found online-   http://www.xojane.com/sex/do-this-dont-abandon-the-slow-fade-meant-to-spare-my-feelings   Everything written there makes perfect sense - except that it fails to address the fact that women do it too, a lot!  I can honestly count on one hand the number of women who ended a relationship with me. All the rest - ""disappeared"". They stopped replying at some point.  I'm no ""Chad"", I don't really have the time nor will power to chase tail all the time. If she's hot and the sex is good - I'm fine with being exclusive (LTR).   I don't call myself a sex god but I'm fairly good at it. I can last a while before climaxing and I go down on them every single time until they orgasm before I penetrate, so they have at least one or two orgasms per session.  I've had more cases than I care to admit that the girl disappeared on me either after the first time we had sex, or after a couple of weeks. There's no pattern on this thing since I've also had a few LTRs so it's nothing in particular that I do bad.  I found this to be true with girls who ""craved"" me, almost tearing my pants off as we were making out - the sex was great, but as soon as I started hinting towards our next meeting - they flaked.  **Story time, you can skip it if you want.** I can vividly remember one girl in particular who was a stereotypical JAP (I am Jewish as well), who I met online, talked to on the phone and we set up a meeting the very same day.  I took her to a cheap motel and was inside of her about 60 minutes into our first meeting IRL. She had a bombshell of a body, big natural boobs and a cute face. The sex was very good, she gave one of the best BJs I've ever received, and she cried at the end (""I don't know why I'm crying, this never happened to me, I'm sorry"") - ahh, orgasm tears, love it.   After our meeting, I tried to keep contact with her but it felt like she was flaking on me. I stopped texting her after about 2 weeks and never heard from her ever since. No explanation, no reasoning whatsoever - she just faded away.  This was just one girl, a similar thing happened to me with countless of other girls.   So, women beg to stop the ""slow fade"", however have no problem doing it themselves.

Ex1: I came across this subreddit while researching for my podcast and it's very cool to see some similar ideas that I discuss in the podcast right here on reddit!  The broader goal of the podcast is about finding happiness rather than just succeeding in dating, relationships, sex, love, etc... (although I'm sure that's not the only thing you guys discuss).  I interview Dr. Lisle every show to go over the science, theory, and practical aspects of evolutionary psychology. He has 30 years of experience as a psychologist using these principles and the way he presents his views, and how he tackles common psychological issues is quite fascinating to me. In essence, what he's saying is if we understand what the genes are trying to get you to do, we can outsmart them and avoid some common traps that can lead to unhappiness, conflict, and stress. We have almost a dozen shows so far and we're making more every week.  Anyway, [last week's show](http://www.blogtalkradio.com/beatyourgenes/2016/04/21/love-dating-sex-and-relationships-with-dr-doug-lisle-phd-part-2) was on Love, Sex, Dating, and Relationships.  I posted to Purple Pill (access it through my post history since I'm not allowed to link it here) and got some great questions to ask him which resulted in a great show. So, I'm reaching out to TRP for the same. If you have any theory/practice/life questions that you'd like to have answered by a psychologist who **gets** evolutionary psychology, fire away.  Also, if you have a personal situation/question that you want to go over beyond just one question, Dr. Lisle is happy to take a few calls during the show. It will be completely anonymous.  If you'd prefer not to call in, you can post some questions in the comment section and I'll have Dr. Lisle answer them on the show.  Thanks!  Live show is on Wednesday, Apr 27 , 7:30-8:30pm PST  Call in Phone number: 657-383-0751  [Podcast Homepage](http://www.blogtalkradio.com/beatyourgenes)   [Upcoming Episode](http://www.blogtalkradio.com/beatyourgenes/2016/04/28/all-about-love-sex-dating-and-relationships-with-psychologist-doug-lisle-phd)     Edit:    Thank you for all the great questions and discussion!  Thank you for everyone who tuned and/or will listen over the next few days.  I got to as many questions from here and PurplePill as I could and will keep going over more next week. 
Ex2: This applies to mainly to school, but it can also apply to work, and other aspects in life.  If you're in college, or even highschool, make sure to participate in class. Pay attention, take notes, and understand the material. If you don't understand something, ask the teacher.   In one of my classes, there's this kid who asks a LOT of questions. Some people find him annoying, but I noticed that these people that find him annoying don't ask any questions and do poorly in the class. The kid that asks a bunch of questions is the type of kid you want in your study group.  Don't feel intimated or stupid to ask a question during class. Paying attention in class will pretty much eliminate your chances of asking a stupid question that embarrasses yourself.  You'll find that if you ask questions during class and participate in classroom discussions, your teacher will like you more, and you shouldn't be surprised if you have a borderline B that gets bumped up to an A.
Ex3: Interviews are weird in the sense that there is too much information available on the internet about how to crack one. You cram the answers to normal HR questions, think 'Okay, at this point I have to butter up the company, at this point I have to explain this, and that etc.' But the truth is that there is just too much uncertainty regarding what would be asked. I cracked one today, and I just want to give back to this community that taught me a lot about life.      As men, the best way to deal with uncertainty is to be comfortable with it. I remember how I hurriedly reached my college where the interview was happening, expected nothing and got it. I will draw some parallels with women and companies too so enjoy.      First off, your CV/SMV is the most important thing. You can't fake it or you might be called out for it unless you are lucky enough to know just enough to get the job done. Say a certain kind of shit test/question that might bring you doen: tackle it with intuition.     Regarding the actual process, many of my peers just wanted A job, not THE job. The way I handled it was that whenever the HR asked me about what's in it for me, I just answered what's in it for me and what do I bring to the table. Simple and efficient: YOU are the PRIZE/THE VACANCY TO BE FILLED. There are too many options for the company-Some who are desperate for a job and will butter them, try to convey they'd do ANYTHING for the job; problem is that they just want a job, attracted by the paycheck/tits and ass and not actually evaluating the position and work culture/personality. Some are incredibly arrogant about getting it, and think they are above the job in a certain way. They can't share the vision of the company/relationship, and let out their own plans oozing of solipsism and the fact that the girl/company doesnt give a fuck if you want to do an MS/how much money you have etc. Your nature, the way you talk and hold frame qualifies itself. You dont have to prove ANYTHING, honesty goes a long way.      Also, I noticed that the thing they liked the most was how I asked questions back, trying to figure out the challenges they faced as a firm, how did they shift from a Service based to a Product based firm and how their clients were affected by it etc., showing that I was actually WILLING to stay and learn more about the industry, I wont be that idiot who just wants the paycheck and then give them a huge F U once the clock hits 5 (hope you can draw the parallels here) but at the same time I was open about what's in it for me, I openly said how Ill handle a new domain and its all for brushing up my skill of programming as a tool and how I want to learn the decision making process of new features. What's in it for me? Clear cut, they know Im being honest and not this Nice Guy who is sitting there cramming the HR questions and the company's objective to MANIPULATE THEM INTO TAKING ME. Fuck that, I didnt even attend the PPT and I told them, calling them out on the quick notice on which they called us in. And its not like I didnt make mistakes, boy I made many. The difference is that I OWNED them, and even explained what my thought process and intent were like when I came up with that stupid answer.      Im sitting here laughing like a maniac after I cracked it. It shouldnt be this easy, you know. And I have no clue how TRP would explain this but at this point of life if I die Id actually be satisfied. I mean, success tastes better than sex right now, I forgot for a while how Im bad with women, or how I have a oneitis and how I was feeling miserable for days thinking about myself and my failures in life, fuck all that! I feel like Im the man right now, winning &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;sex and women. I came, I gave the interview, I conquered.  
Ex4: Many years ago when Dr. Phil (yes, that Dr. Phil) was a flash in the pan, I remember watching one of his shows about relationship psychology.  In it he simply stated that you make a statement - then anything that follows the word BUT is immediately a way to justify false behavior and invalidates anything said before it.    This always resonated with me and I have used it throughout my years to make myself realize when I'm using false validation to justify what could potentially be a bad choice.  It's simple but effective.    Recently on asktrp there have been a rash of ""this girl did x BUT"" posts.  For example:  ""This girl told me we can't have sex BUT she's a 9 and really cool so should I keep trying"".  No.  Next.  Simple answer but many here don't seem to understand it.    This applies to many areas in life.  ""I want a better job BUT the one I'm in now pays well and gives me benefits.  Should I change?""  No.  Because you don't really want to badly enough, if you did you wouldn't ask the question.  ""My relationship has all sorts of red flags BUT she's never been shady before, should I trust her?"".  No.  Because you know what she's doing and need to get the hell out.  ""I set up a date with this girl and she flaked BUT she said she's free next week.  Should I give her another chance?""  No.  If she wanted to see you she wouldn't have flaked.    The next time you make a statement and have to put a BUT with it , think about the original statement and ask yourself if you're really trying to just talk yourself out of a decision or a question that you really know the answer to.  Applying this in many areas of your life not only helps you make firm decisions without constantly second guessing yourself but it also allows you to really evaluate what is going on with relationships and even situations you might need a decision about.

Ex1: Full article here: http://therationalmale.com/2015/12/16/open-relationships/  Force Fitting Sexual Strategies  What we’re observing in a modern interpretation of ‘poly’ or ‘open relationships’ is a conflict between the normalization of unilateral control of sexual strategy within a monogamous relationship context. I know that sounds like a mouthful but consider…  The Cardinal Rule of sexual strategies: For one gender’s sexual strategy to succeed the other gender must compromise or abandon their own.  No doubt many Blue and Purple Pill readers will (in the interests of “equality”) remind us that there was a time when it was socially expected of (high socio-economic status) men to “keep” a mistress (or use prostitutes) as well as a wife, or even have many wives. All socio-economic Apex Fallacies aside, this being an outlier rather than a norm, those arrangements still put that man into a position of maintaining support for both (all) women in order to satisfy his sexual appetites as well as the relative wellbeing of them.  In the modern instance where western(ized) women are a protected class in a feminine-primary social order, the priority of sexual strategy changes hands. I cover this exchange in the Adaptation series of posts, but to paraphrase, Free Love, open relationships or now, ‘poly’, has really become an increasingly acceptable methodology for women to optimize both the Alpha Fucks and Beta Bucks aspects of Hypergamy while still enjoying a semblance of the security that old order monogamy provides for women’s emotional needs.  Now lets review The Cardinal Rule of Relationships:  In any relationship, the person with the most power is the one who needs the other the least.  In an economic state where women are less financially dependent on (or autonomous from) men, the Alpha Fucks aspect of Hypergamy will take priority. That’s not to say the Beta comfort and rapport appeal becomes worthless as an emotional investment, but it’s less likely for a woman to need to prioritize that aspect while pursuing the Alpha Fucks aspect. Beta comfort and security have a value, but that value requires less urgency than pursing Alpha sexual experience (functional breeding opportunities).  Consider the poor Beta symp in the cartoon. That caricature is of a Beta conditioned man struggling with the Old Set of Books, with the old order ruleset expectations from a woman who will never recognize them because she’s never needed to. It’s his investment in her, his necessitousness, his optionlessness and his inability to see it’s the source of his frustration and his anxiety. He needs her, expects more from her, than she needs him.  The lie inherent in the humor of the cartoon is that women possess the capacity to compartmentalize their emotional investments. The Medium is the Message; women can only compartmentalize their feelings for men they don’t see as Hypergamously optimal men (i.e. Alpha, higher than their own SMV men). For men who embody that optimization, women simply cannot afford to feel anything more than submission (a submission to a dominant man they innately desire) to him and are thus unable to consider anything like compartmentalizing their emotions for him.  And from Schedules of Mating:  For a female of any species to facilitate a methodology for breeding with the best genetic partner she’s able to attract AND to ensure her own and her offspring’s survival with the best provisioning partner; this is an evolutionary jackpot.  ‘Open’ relationships, and the social narrative reinforcement of the concept, are one such adaptation to facilitate this methodology.
Ex2: One of the things that many people say about us is how pissed we sound or mad. And yes unplugging will make you pissed no doubt. But lately I have been trying to find things about women that are good. And infact they are not even bad. They simply have a different sexual strategy than us in a culture that protects them to the utmost and tells them they are victims. It's hypocrisy. But no one girl I know caused the matrix to exist. And let's face it if women could have a logic based philosophy like ours they could rip us apart as well for our sexual strategy.   So lately I have tried to find what are things I actually like about women? Not in some blue pill way but genuine being unplugged what is something I see in them that is good or noble?    I would love if anyone would play along and add something you see in women with no blue pill oneitis crap going on.   I work in a male dominated Industry. Probably 10 women to 100 men. Now in this dynamic something kinda cool has happened. The girls that work there very much go way out of there way to serve the men who are nothing more than co-workers. The girls go pick up lunch and make it a point to go ask the guys what they want and they go get lunch. Further they always have this natural desire to serve the men. I had one go through my voicemail box the other day just because ""she was bored"" but it took her like 20 minutes and she got nothing from it I'm just her co-worker not a boss or anything. Maybe Rollo can explain this dynamic. Let me also say the girls don't always do this for every guy. They definitely go overboard with high value males but they do it with. Low value perceived as well.    It's kinda cool dynamic and it's something that helps me get past all the things I understand about women.    Anyone got any?
Ex3: I have just about made up my mind. I will no longer be truthful about my solely sexual intentions, and will not continue to be true to my word and promises.   I am a little over 2 months out of an addiction, my life is slowly coming back together. I am a recent college grad. In college, I had to learn how miserable the man-to-woman sexual relationship is. How tough it is for an average or even above average man to consistently have sex with average or above average women. I had a lot of sex (with an extremely high number of women), but with mostly unattractive to average women.   I got back on Tinder and have lowered my standards incomprehensibly and am still failing to score. I have gotten at least a few to text my phone, but they soon stop responding once a meet up is proposed.   I have decided the best way to counteract this miserable fate which has been making me masturbate at my job's bathroom, considering getting back into drugs and causing me to lose my happiness with what progress I've been making, is to create a fake identity for myself. To create a fake, interesting story about who I am. To lie about my intentions. To pretend like I want to date women. And then proceed to date a few. And then some. And continue to lie and get more and more women. Then ultimately once I get bored with specific women either completely cut them out of my life, or even, sadistically, reveal to them that I had been unfaithful and had lied to them.   This is of course stemming from anger, bitterness and resentment against women. But I can no longer tolerate the complete apathetic, hypergamous, flaky nature of women. I want revenge. And I want it to be served cold.   I have decided to message a couple more girls with normal non-sexual-intentioned conversation, and see if they will continue to be as sick as they have proven to me over the years. If they surprise me and turn out to be good, I will abort this plan. If they fail the test, then I will be devising an extremely intelligent and well-crafted plan to make the lives of countless women absolutely miserable.   Thoughts?   EDIT: The commenters are lashing out without even providing logic to their accusations. Is that the white-knight in y'alls DNA coming out? Use your intelligence guys. Provide logic and reasoning and convince me. You're just motivating me to go through with this plan. In fact I have already messaged a girl who is ""looking for a relationship"". This is gonna be so much fun.   EDIT 2:  For those wondering, no, I am not cursed with terrible looks, I am not old, and I am not fat. I work out regularly, am considered decently attractive (enough to get initial attraction with women), and I do not display signs of social awkwardness/shyness. My sole problem was that I was too eager/forward about my sexual intentions. Women will get what is coming to them. A man who will lie, cheat and manipulate to get what he wants from them. And the cycle of life and evolution of our doomed female human will continue.

Ex1: Hi Everyone,  **UPDATE - I am going to talk to her about the money / sex comment she made last night and tell her it is unacceptable way to speak / treat me if we are to get married and that I will not stand for it. I will let you know how it goes **  Thank you for all the feedback you have provided. I have decided to write this separate post because there were just to many comments to reply to on my original post.  There are some issues that need to be faced. I know deep down I need to face them and I don't think 'next' is the correct answer. When I wrote my post, I didn't write anywhere saying what should I do? or please help, I didnt post to ASKTRP, I posted to TRP. I ended my post with with ""This is the red pill theories in action. Women don't love men like men love women. I love my fiance, but she obviously doesn't love me like i love her.""  I was trying to show everyone that women don't love us like we love them, it is conditional. We have the burden of performance which I am obviously not living up to. I wasn't asking, how do I break up with her?  Think about this, I break up with my Fiance, then what happens? Unless I improve myself, raise my SMV, perform better, I will either a) settle for someone below my SMV or b) have the same thing happen to me again. Wouldn't it be better for me to raise my SMV and performance before breaking up? Therefore being single and high SMV rather than single and low SMV? Seems like a much better position of power.  The thing is my Fiance is very attractive, high SMV and my SMV is obviously to low at the moment. Which means that in terms of the level of SMV I have obtained in a partner, I am doing very well  The comments section mainly said break up with her, but I got some good PM's from people that I am very grateful for.  I am going to focus on the root cause of the issue, rather than the bandaid break up response. I am going to focus on my SMV and my ability to provide.  But mark my words, I do have my limits and my line in the sand, any cheating or nonsense like that will be an automatic breakup and I will not budge on that one.  We all have our different amounts of red pill. Some people will never marry, some do and thats why we have the married red pill. I will marry, but I am not going to be walked all over. My plan at the moment is: - Increase SMV - Incease burden of performance - Implement Dread  any feedback on my tactics would be appreciated, but simple lines like dump her are not helpful.  I will update the red pill regularly because my original post was very popular 500+ comments and I will let you all know how I go. If I crash and burn and get divorce raped, you will all know about it. 
Ex2: **Introduction**  *The Cock Carousel™ and Bitch Face™ go together for a reason.*  &amp;nbsp;  **Body**  The Cock Carousel™ does heavy damage to the subconscious mind of women.  Try to imagine what a women is going through.  Her body is hormonally designed to mate with the male she is attached to and when that linkage is destroyed it creates in her mind a sort of wound.  High N Count women develop the Thousand Cock Stare™ which is the accumulation of this damage over time.  The **more attractive** the woman (SMV 8 or SMV 9) in our ""Current Year"" culture the more damage she likely absorbs.  The Bitch Face™ is both the natural reaction to the damage and also encouraged by Feminism.  When women are unhappy they naturally wear the Bitch Face™ because they feel bad and express that as being bitchy.  They feel like crap and want you to break her free of it.  &amp;nbsp;  *Masculine polarity makes women happy.*  &amp;nbsp;  If you ever observe the successful LTR / Marriage couples the ***women are always smiling***.  You just don't see unhappy women when they are near her prized Alpha male.  &amp;nbsp;  **Conclusion**  The Bitch Face™ is created by the Cock Carousel™.  If you see the Bitch Face™ you know she is:  &amp;nbsp;  * Damaged by the Cock Carousel™.  * Likely of high SMV.  * Observing the guidance of Feminism that says it's good idea. (not)  * Very unhappy because she has no man. (wounded and angry bitch)  * Seeking a masculine man because as her prize it makes her ***SMILE***.  &amp;nbsp;  Turn that Bitch Face™ into a ***SMILE*** and you achieved masculine polarity in the relationship.  One might even say this is the best litmus test for the presence of masculine polarity.  &amp;nbsp;  *Men love women, women love children, children love puppies.*  &amp;nbsp;  Your pet should (ideally) be well trained, obedient, happy and:  &amp;nbsp;  ***SMILING***.  &amp;nbsp;     
Ex3: Decided to make a post out of this since my comment would be drowned otherwise. I'll keep it short.  &gt; A hot girl doesn’t make you nervous because she’s hot, she makes you nervous because sleeping with her represents a personal victory, and getting rejected by her represents a personal defeat.   While this is correct, it doesn't explain WHY it is a personal victory / defeat.  It's all about value. All of us have a certain idea about our own SMV. Women have this too. When a low SMV man approaches a woman, who perceives herself as higher SMV than that man, she will take it as an insult. Why? Because she believes the man to be of a lower SMV, and if he thinks he has a shot with her, he must see her SMV as close to his. This is the insult: the man implicitly tells the woman she's low(er) SMV. Experienced redpillers will have been approached by lower SMV women and thought: 'you really believe you stand a chance getting with me?'. Couple this with insecurity and you get a woman's mind, and why they take it as an insult/personal defeat.   TRP's goal is to increase SMV. When you've 'proven' your SMV by (repeatedly, or LTR) getting a woman of a certain SMV, you'll no longer get nervous with women of her SMV. 'Hot girls' that make you nervous will have a higher SMV (in your own  subjective opinion) than you attribute to yourself. This poses the opportunity to measure your perceived SMV in her eyes, and your own: getting with 'hot girls' (consistently) means your SMV is above theirs (women only date up)!   So getting with this hot girl feels like a true evaluation of your SMV, and thát is what makes you nervous.   If you would get her, it'd feel like a personal victory (higher SMV). If you wouldn't it'd feel like a personal defeat (lower SMV).  Disclaimer: how women see your SMV depends on how you act. If you get nervous, she'll know, and link it with a low self worth (low SMV). Take the woman of the pedestal, ignore your emotion, be rational, behave as you would with a low SMV girl and prove her (and yourself) your SMV is higher than hers!
Ex4: So I'm currently in the anger/jaded fucking hatred phase it would seem.   There's something that's been bothering me for a long time, and I hope you guys can help me think about it differently or something. It is the disparity between how Rollo's SMV peaks play out in the real world. Rollo states that women's SMV ""burns fast and hot"" while men's ""burns long and slow""...as if this is some sort of wash. It certainly doesn't seem like it.  &amp;nbsp;  In the US, particularly outside of the giant metropolitan areas, people marry for the first time in their mid-20s. Which means they are single from 18 to around 22-23(their college years). At this point, women's SMV is peaking, so they can...without any effort...have a ton of casual fun and truly experience their ""party years"", before cashing in their chips on the best guy who's around at the end of college (when her SMV is still high). So women get to USE their SMV peak easily to get BOTH plenty of casual fun AND a high value husband. These husbands seem to be 1-2 years older than them.   &amp;nbsp;  Men's SMV on the other hand is in the toilet from 18-22, so they work extremely hard on self-improvement, social skills, etc in order to reap minimal returns(if any). Many are like me, and didn't find out about the red pill until they were in their mid-20s, at which point the ""everyone's single"" years are gone. The theory here, is that a man who goes into his late 20's or early 30's single will be peaking in terms of his SMV....but what fucking good is it at that point? All the quality women he previously didn't have access to would theoretically be available to him now...but they're all fucking married and popping out kids. That means he has to look to younger women, but those younger women are now peaking, so it's not exactly some sort of cake-walk. Let's say you're 30 and looking for a wife because you want kids and a family (yeah yeah, we get it, we know you think marriage is bullshit, save your comments). That means you have to either A. Find a needle in a haystack (high value woman who's still unmarried and childless in late 20s) or B. You have to wife up some 22 year old who's not very mature, and who has a very highly inflated sense of her own value because she never experienced the decline.   &amp;nbsp;  Help me think about this a different way, because right now, the only way I see this working out well for men is if they are not interested in having a family and only want to use their peak SMV to hook up with young women in their party phase. It seems like if a man wants a family, he has to settle in his mid-20s for a woman below him in value, or get the sloppy seconds version of a woman who was high value but now is divorced with a couple of kids (shudder).

Ex1: Now by 'bone I don't mean REAL skeletons or corpses per se. And yeah, I'm using the term 'dysphemistically'. Here the 'bone' refers to a past 'dead' episode, a comment or details. And you use these bones in a mind game to trip up a woman, to contradict her--usually to defend yourself, but often to 'win' and control the current real-time space. Often you don't have to do any hard collecting because women often provide the 'bones' themselves  with what they've said or done before, BUT forgotten about.  But here's my classic example: My 'wife' does a lot of housework and lets me know, so one day I watched over what she actually did. Then I looked for the areas she'd missed, nothing came to mind but I stored it in my mind to find something; to 'look for bones'--then one day as I was preparing a meal I realised that the knives were blunt. In fact they were ALWAYS blunt and I could never remember her (or me) sharpening them. OK, that was one bone. Then I remembered that the light in our dining room didn't work properly either. We'd never noticed because we never used it. The room was an offshoot of the kitchen which provided a strong bright light. OK, that was the second bone. Now I didn't bring either of these matters up with my wife. I stored them, kept them secret, and waited. Then eventually it happened--out of the blue--I was relaxing after a heavy week away at work. I'd returned, first day off and was relaxing on the couch. Strange during these times the wife seemed to be at a frenzy cleaning. Why couldn't it occur BEFORE I got home? Then my wife 'reminded' me how lucky I was. That I could just relax because SHE did all the work around the house, and kept everything shipshape. SHIPSHAPE. That was my cue...""How come everything is shipshape when we haven't got a sharp knife in the house and the Dining light hasn't worked for years,"" I said. It worked a treat. She mumbled something and walked over to the knife set. Within 10 minutes I heard her furiously sharpening one of the blunt carving knives. I had dominated the space--with pure good common reason, evidence and a valid argument. Like a lawyer I picked my moment to present my 'exhibits'--the bones that I'd collected. And I was 'King' for a day.
Ex2: I was at the dear lease and a similar aged cousin and I had some whiskey and talked long into the night.  Sex came up and I have been with my wife for almost 15 years and I have been tracking it for the past 2 out of curiosity.  I showed him the frequency of our love life after being together for so long as we average 22.8 sessions a month.  After I told him my thoughts and philosophy he told me about Red Pill.  She is my second wife and my first wife treated me to a dead bedroom and took advantage of a young feminist raised man.  Once I got divorced it shook me to my core and changed the way I am with everyone but particularly with women.  1.  I am me and I honestly don't care of you don't like it.  I am loud and what comes up in my head comes out of my mouth.  I am very much a take me for who I am or leave me type of person.  2.  I have hobbies outside of my relationship.  I enjoy hiking, golfing, hanging out with other male friends and I do that without her and without her permission.  I will let her know what I am doing as a courtesy.  3. I lift heavy shit twice a week.  I overhead press 185, bench 315, squat 340 so I am stronger than most.  My wife likes my strength and likes how I am stronger than most. This is known by how she touches me and feels me up.  I lift for me and not for any other reason than to not be a weak ass pussy.  4.  I let my lust be known to my wife.  I am an alpha and I let it be known to her that she turns me on and I have needs.  I don't give two shit's is she is initiating or not......I do 90% of it and am quite fine with that.  If I was to wait for her to do it we would go down to 2-3 times a month.  I hit on her, slap her ass, fondle her, as she is mine.    5. She knows my expectations in the bedroom over frequency etc.  So if she isn't up to the task there are alternatives to PiV and she uses them on me.....not in a get it over way......in a ""see how much I can blow the socks of my husband"" way.  So nights where she isn't in the mood are quit ok with me.  6.  If there is an honest rejection I don't wine about it or beg or anything.  She respects me and I respect her and I know she is not blowing smoke up my ass.  If she says tomorrow......it will happen tomorrow.  7.  I clean the kitchen......that is all I do.  I don't even know how the vacuum works.  I am the primary earner so I don't do much around the house at all.  These are not rules I live by but observations on what makes me different from other ""men"". All I know is I have more sex than any one else in my social circle and I honestly think this is why.
Ex3: I know this subject is brought up on this sub literally every day, so I might be beating a dead horse but something happened recently to a family friend that I want to share. My dad's best friend's wife recently left him. This guy is one of the most alpha men I have ever met, a real old school badass that never took shit off anyone, male or female. And always had his shit together, everything he owned was paid for in cash.    Just for some background, he and his wife just celebrated their thirtieth anniversary in January, that's right, thirty years. They have two kids that are in their 20's.  He's drove a truck nearly all his life, usually local but occasionally over the road here and there.   Two weeks ago he accepted a run that took him about a week to complete. When he got home he said his wife was unusually quiet. He asked her if she felt ok and she told him that she had enjoyed him not being there for the past week, she didn't love him anymore and that she would be moving to her sister's house the next morning. Just like that, no discussions, no tears. His wife had accepted a clerical job at an attorneys office about six months beforehand and it recently came to light she was fucking the owner of the firm.    My point is this, you can be the most alpha guy around, work your ass off, have your shit together, marry a women that you love, buy a house, have children, stay together thirty years... but if she gets tingles for a lawyer that drives a new Porsche and you're blue collar, she's gone, along with at least half your shit.    I'm not one of these guys that are going to tell you never to get married, I myself am engaged. Just remember the prenup and never get too attached because AWALT. 
Ex4: I just had to share this, as usually we hear the opposite  I was listening to LBC (Leading Britains Conversation) earlier today, and it was discussing a recent divorce story of a man who was cheating on his wife, the wife files for divorce, the high court orders her to give £2MILLION to the 'Husband' to settle the divorce! The wife earned over £10m in bonuses over their 4 years of the relationship. No children involved.  I find this astonishing, I see so many horror stories on here about how the man gets divorce raped for everything he has but this seems to be one of those rare cases where the tables were dramatically turned  Of course, there was a massive outrage about this, with people saying how it isn't fair and blah blah blah, but if this was the other way around, it would not have even been mentioned. We all know the score.  This guy is the luckiest man alive. Gets out of his shit marriage, has another plate on the go (perhaps multiple) and now has £2MILLION extra to his name for it  Madness!  I guess the divorce rape situation can (sometimes) swing both ways.   I'm grateful I've found this sub at a young age, and i know never to get married, which is the moral of this story yet again. But perhaps for women with lots of wealth, maybe they shouldn't either as she obviously made a costly mistake here  Thoughts

8,Gendered Roles,"Ex1: **Disclaimer**   &amp;nbsp;  *The article is 2 years old so this may have been posted before, but I just found it.*  &amp;nbsp;  **tl dr**  Bloopers will shame you for not having homosexual sex.  &amp;nbsp;  **Intro**  Bloopers engaged in total war for your mind. My theory is that they will try to fill your brain with so much cognitive dissonance that you literally cannot tell left from right, right from wrong, male from female. The newest shaming tactic will be that it is *gay* for straight males to **not** suck dick. They live in some alternate bizzaro dimension of reality.  &amp;nbsp;  **Body**  [Archive.is: Mirror.uk, Transgender girl says she is rejected by straight guys for 'having male parts'](http://archive.is/2wMK3)  **Yeah, no shit** straight guys don't find males attractive. But I imagine they will be teaching that this is homophobia or make it part of ""diversity training"" in sex ed class.  &gt; The doc shows the moment Claire, from Virginia, meets a guy that she likes, only to be rejected by him as soon as he finds out she was born a boy.  Natural reaction.  &gt; The boys, who were originally attracted to Claire, did not call after finding out that she is trans. ""That's it, silence,"" says Claire. ""Like nothing from them again.""  Guess normies haven't gone full cuck yet.  &gt; ""Straight guys just can't get over you having the male parts.  *For real, girlfriend?!*  &gt; They hang out together, see friends and go to the movies, but their love is one in a million - Arin was born a girl and Katie was born a boy. They are both transgender.  LMAO... WTF... They both switched genders, so are they straight again?  &gt; emotional rollercoaster of what it is to be transgender, from the lows of bullying, abuse and suicide attempts to their joy as they undergo hormone treatments and surgery.  Sounds healthy.  &amp;nbsp;  **Lessons Learned**  * Discard the BluePill propaganda like your life depends on it. * Teach your sons and daughters to reject blooper shaming tactics. * The way the enemy works is to slowly normalize degenerate behavior until, after some generations, they are fucking you in the ass. Literally. 
Ex2: From Fox News:   [Male Backlash Against Metoo is Brewing](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/02/04/male-backlash-against-metoo-is-brewing.html)  &gt;Men are scared, and feminists are delighted. But the urge to call out and punish male sexual transgression is bound to clash with an inescapable truth: We’re all in this together, men and women.  Read carefully.  Men being ""scared"" is fine until it affects......women!  &gt;Female staffers and lobbyists have found “many male legislators will no longer meet with them privately,” reported The Miami Herald. “I had a senator say, ‘I need my aide here in the room because I need a chaperone,’ ” lobbyist Jennifer Green told the paper. “I said, ‘Senator, why do you need a chaperone? . . . Do you feel uncomfortable around me?’ ‘Well,’ he said, ‘anyone can say anything with the door shut.’ ”  Oh No!  Women are being affected by the whole Metoo thing.  It is time to back off!  We are all in this together don't ya know.  Men and women, together.  Forever.  LMFAO.  &gt;“I’m getting the feeling that we’re going back 20 years as female professionals,” said Green, who owns her company. “I fully anticipate I’m going to be competing with another firm that is currently owned by some male, and the deciding factor is going to be: ‘You don’t want to hire a female lobbying firm in this environment.’ ”  HAHHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAHH!!!!!!!  Do you mean that extreme actions beget extreme reactions?  Who knew?  &gt;This kind of thinking is catching on in aggressively P.C. Silicon Valley, where men are taking to message boards like Reddit to express interest in sex segregation — sometimes labeled “Men Going Their Own Way,” or the “Man-o-Sphere.”   Yah!  She said it.  So what is important about MGTOW and the Manosphere?  &gt;How will that work out for women in the tech industry, where they already face substantial challenges?  Of course.  My guess is not good.  The Pence rule, as advocated by none other than the professor, is now in full force and effect.  Men are not stupid and we are not going to be put into helpless situations where 'anybody can say anything' BUT women are to be believed.  Nope!  &gt;Several major companies have told us they are now limiting travel between the genders  Yes they are.  But don't forget what is important.  How is all this going to affect THE WOMEN!  &gt;If men start to back away from women, at least in professional settings, it’s difficult to see how that will aid the feminist cause.  Oh, so not good huh.  Maybe this Metoo thing wasn't such a good idea.  Maybe going for the jugular and total supremacy was a bridge to far?  Of course none of that matters.  The important thing is how it affects the women.  Got it.  Goddesses must be comfortable.  KK.    Wait, what happens if we decide to MAKE THEM A BIT UNCOMFORTABLE? Maybe something happens?  Who knows.  &gt;be wary of unintended consequences. Turning men and women into hostile opposing camps is not going to be good for either sex.  We are WAY past that point broh.  Way past it.
Ex3: Kitten is still struggling to come to terms with having to share my attention with FunSize, not to mention the occasional plate. FunSize, of course, is experienced at this, and has no issues, but Kitten feels threatened by her very presence, and won't talk to her for long enough to bond and stop seeing her as a threat.  Since Kitten is actually Dr. Kitten, PhD, she likes to intellectualize things that upset her, thinking about them in abstract terms rather than as they relate to her personally. This gives her emotional distance so she can cope. So the other day (I actually started writing this sometime back, so it was a while ago now), she hits me with this question:  ""How does polygamy [by which she means polygyny] fit into evo psych? How did monogamy [by which she means monogyny] form?""  Fleshing out the gist of my answer into a compete description for TRP:  **Polygyny** is a mating strategy optimized for replacing combat losses, because one man can easily keep multiple women pregnant. It's used by warlike societies, or those with high male-specific mortality rates.  **Monogyny** is a mating strategy optimized for appeasing low-tier males, because it guarantees them a mate. It's used by peaceful societies which depend on beta male labour and cooperation for their prosperity.  *Polygyny's effect upon the Sexual Marketplace is to increase the availability of apex males.*  This benefits:  [Read the rest on trp.red...](https://www.trp.red/p/whisper/726)

9,Media,"Ex1: Hey all  On April 3rd 2017 Andrew The Private Man died from a rare form of eye cancer. He was an alumni speaker of The 21 Convention, a prolific red pill blogger, and a confirmed speaker for The 21 Convention 2017.  When it became increasingly apparent he was going to die before the event, I decided to dedicate the 10 year anniversary of the event to him. He accepted the dedication in person in South Florida.  The video published today on the anniversary of his death is a panel of the speakers who knew him best at the event. All ads have been disabled on the video.  Check it out at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X5IB_c7HFI  We have additional videos of Andrew linked in the YouTube cards of this new video, as well as 1 more video from the 2017 event that focuses on Andrew.
Ex2: Been getting back into the gym recently after winning a 2 year long battle against some injuries and came across this video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71zyEOzerbw  If you're at TRP and have read into stuff, chances are, the name Dmitry Klokov rings a bell. Olympic weightlifter (2008 silver) that is now seemingly a sickunt elite weightlifting trainer. One he has a hell of a strong and proportional physique (I'd argue that sorta physique is the goal) and two, he has game. Watch any video and look at the way he can control any audience, espeically women.   Watch the first minute of the video and watch this girl he is supposed to train literally utter the words ""I felt the need to obey him because he is so big and manly""  Gym works boiz
Ex3: **Summary**: Man catches wife cheating with friend. Videos for evidence. Video is posted on a default sub-reddit and majority of comments are red-pill.  **Body**: I haven't posted on The Red Pill since way back when links were allowed, but this one is too good not to share. There's currently a video that was posted into the videos default sub-reddit of a man catching his wife in the act of cheating with one of his friends.  The man videoed the encounter presumably to be used as fuel in a divorce proceeding. The comments on the videos thread are actually quite red-pill.  You can see the video here: https://www.youtube.com/v/IcbFjLFA4Ec [NFSW: Very slight nudity]  **Lessons learned**: Collect as much evidence as you can. AWALT.  EDIT: [Including link to reddit video comments.](https://archive.is/DmoS6) TRP relevant comments begin around the third thread down.
Ex4: Tl;dr Your goals are always more important than women. Make sure you do everything you can to accomplish your mission. Your woman can either be an anchor or a booster.  Here is the video in question: [Goals over Girls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4RgAlz2pmM). A lot of you probably know Elliott, those who don't - he is known mostly for his youtube videos about fitness and vlogs.  In his recent video he responds to a viewer's question, a guy whose goal is to make career in music, but his gf is afraid that he will be financially unstable and wants him to make a diploma. The guy goes on: &gt; I wanna have both her and music, but if I'm not going to get a degree she may end up breaking up with me, because she doesn't want to struggle financially.  Now Elliott drops one of the core RP truths, telling a story from his life: &gt; So when I started dating Kelly in high school, I was already very clear about my purpose. I knew I was either going to be a professional athlete or a coach.[...] I warned her: I'm going hard. I've a mission. It's going to be a bumpy road I'm on. I'm ready for the struggle, but I'm not going to stop until I get where I'm going. I love you, but this is where I'm going. You can either come with me or not.  A lot of you probably will disagree with him, saying shit like: 'You can't say that to women, you must show it!' or that expressing your affection is a mistake. What I see instead is a man who didn't waste a second on bullshitting. He had his mission, no time wasted. By the way, he end up marrying her and they are together to this day.  Later he explains the difference between women and man and says: &gt; I recognize the feminine in my wife and I do my best to create an environment for her, so she can blossom fully. But she also, very early on, gave me room and encouraged me on my purpose, on my mission. And she has reaped the gifts.  Guys, it's your journey. It's time to realise that you're the prize. If the woman is good at being a woman, allow her to join you, but don't lose your focus. Eyes on the mission.  &gt; A lot of women try to knock men off their paths. Like you! - he refers to the music guy - You're about to get into that trap! You love her, I get it. You love her, but mission is number one for men.  Translation: dump her. If someone doesn't support your cause, don't waste time. You have one mission and one life. There is no time for people who slow you down.  I have written this for you to give you a general idea about what he is talking about. Go ahead and watch it, you won't regret. Eyes on the mission!  **Lessons learned:**  * Your mission is the most important thing in your life  * Women can join you if they want, but dont lose your focus  * Next people who don't support you, reward people who do

Ex1: Can someone define the term **charming behaviour**? Everyone keeps telling that it is a vital point to have it, yet there are contradictory definitions of what it is. For example a lot of people are recommending *How to win friends and influence people*, on the other hand, some RP guys are saying that it only teaches you to be a beta with women and you need a different type of approach with them. What is the difference then? Should you have a different type of charm toward friends, collegues, strangers compared to girls you want to pick up? Can you provide some examples, like movie characters, video clips of what charming behaviour looks like? And finally, can you recommend some books to read about it, which you found useful in the subject?
Ex2: So far, every therapist I used to see show little to no masculinity, and if you think about it caring for others, telling people what you think they want to hear, and therapy are all feminine traits. I told my last therapist I was reading ""The Way of Man"" by Jack Donovan and he disagreed with most of the book. That's when it struck me: ""All therapists are blue pilled"". I later ended our sessions and moved on with my life. Instead of seeing a therapist, I'll lift, meditate, eat better, and talk to women, merely hanging out with them. (Tao of Steve)  Lessons Learned:  A therapist won't make you masculine. You have to do that on your own.  Take care of yourself. Eat better, workout, and meditate and surround yourself with good friends. If you don't have good friends, go find some. Go anywhere. Just make connections. That alone will help you feel much better than 50 therapy sessions.
Ex3: I posted this list as a comment some time ago. I referenced it a few times, but I always thought I'd need to expand it and make it into a post, for better referencing.  There are plenty of good TRP-themed books to read, but no official list. There are a few (good) posts with (lots of) recommended books but they're a large menu à la carte. Here's my personal fine-cuisine full course **for the newly unplugging**. Short, tasty, and **to be consumed in the right order**.  ---  ## Hors d'oeuvre  The couple of very best ""mainstream-friendly"" books on the importance of masculinity, to start gently and arouse curiosity:  * 1- ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"", by Robert Glover  * 2- ""The Way of The Superior Man"", by David Deida  ## Entrées  Which should hopefully be enough to pave the way for the upcoming shock of unplugging that comes when you swallow the red pill bible:  * 3- ""The Rational Male"", by Rollo Tomassi  * 4- ""The Rational Male Preventive Medicine"", by Rollo Tomassi  (Note: Rollo now has a third book out, which is just as good, and reads better, but the basics are in the first two and remember this list is about efficient unplugging so let's carry on..)  ## Main  Once aware that everything he knew about the world of humans' interactions was a lie, our unplugged man will then find the best general information on how to deal with Men and Women in the Real World in:  * 5- ""The 48 Laws of Power"", by Robert Greene  * 6- ""Practical Female Psychology For the Practical Man"", by Joseph South, David Clare and Franco  ## Dessert  And only then, when our red-pill-aware man finally understands the theory on the real nature of women and of human interactions, he might want to read the best books that put that theory into practice to game and bang women:  * 7- ""Bang"" and ""Day bang"", by Roosh V  * 8- ""Sex God Method"", by Daniel Rose   ## Coffee and cigars  With his eyes finally open and his sexual lust quenched temporarily, the newly unplugged man may feel at loss in this scary but very real world. He will need to redefine himself and his place in it. I then recommend:  * 9- ""Meditations"", by Marcus Aurelius  * 10- ""The Way of Men"", by Jack Donovan  ---  Knowledge is Power. Sharpen your understanding of red pill wisdom to maximize the results that actions (lifting and approaching) already started giving you. A post on this sub's daily feed with a score under 100 is guaranteed to contain less wisdom than a book deemed vital to read by the red pill community. Your daily time allowance for absorbing information is limited. Prioritize your reading.  
Ex4: Everybody knows we're hip, which is why we use hashtags. And today's hashtag is the [#BookShelfChallenge](https://www.trp.red/feed/hashtag/BookShelfChallenge).

What books provide good insight into the world, or elucidate a point that is otherwise misunderstood by the masses?  So today we have the [#BookShelfChallenge](https://www.trp.red/feed/hashtag/BookShelfChallenge). Post a picture or list of the books on your shelf that you think are quality reads that others should check out.

Then Mike went to high school and something really bad happened. Mike was tested - shit tested - by life. Life told Mike ""You can't"". He had tried out for the school's varsity basketball team and he got rejected. At that moment, Mike had a choice. **He could give up and submit to his insecurities - giving up basketball forever - or he could adopt an abundance mentality and interpret this event as positive.** Immediately after being rejected from the basketball team he stormed home, locked himself in his room, and cried. He was crushed. Trembling, he looked into the mirror and made a promise to himself that he would never let this happen again. Ever.  Mike began practicing everyday, pushing himself harder and harder. His life was basketball first, family second, school third. He became supremely focused on basketball. And day by day, he got better. And better. And better. The next year, he joined the high school varsity team and eventually became MVP.   Mike had channeled his pain into a habit. And habits - not desires, pussies, or money - are what transform individuals. **Habits give you value. The world respects habits.** Mike never gave up on  his habits, and while his peers were growing up and going through life like everyone else with a career, going out, and investing in fake realities - Mike was improving his game.   Mike ended up having a pretty good life. He went on to play ball in college, became national MVP, joined the NBA, won a gold medal in the Olympics, became scoring champion for a number of years, won several dunk contests, was 6 time NBA Champion and MVP, made a billion dollars selling sneakers, had a bunch of kids, and married a 10/10 latina.   A lot of people want to be like Mike. Learn from Mike. Build habits that will get you to where you want to go. Be consistent. The world rewards consistency and skill. Whether you're building a business, a craft, or a career.   **There's no way to AMOG the best. Money talks, shit walks. Be money. Be like Mike.**
Ex2:  In college I was a douche, typical chad as 4chan would say. It seriously works is the worst part.   In high school I was a good boy, good grades, never getting detention etc. and life was miserable.   I started college after getting out of a LTR, and was ready to have fun.  Step one get in great shape, girls don’t want to admit it but, looks are key. 2 live life like you don’t care and people will try to mimic you to fit in around you.  I was living a double life in class typical geek good grades and studying, not much social life with them but it was all about getting good grades as well as good recommendations from teachers.   When I would get out of class I had a whole different friend group that seemed to be a pussy magnet. We started our own club space and had new girls joining every week.   I would put on my persona, developed a great reputation for in the sack and had girls coming to me, it was too easy. As long as I acted the opposite of boyfriend material and kept it all businesses and sex, more always came my way.   Developed a huge network of fuck friends and would fuck 3 different girls a day, was a common experience. they would actually bring me drugs and food and drinks to my place i didn't even have to spend any money on them.   Then I started to like one, nope that's where you fuck up. Guess what, gave her the dating experience etc., and didn’t even get laid. If I had just been a dick to her, easily would have got laid.  Honestly giving the dating experience to one girl was the worst thing I could. Word got out girls stopped coming by my place etc. its all about how you’re perceived.   From there it was downhill.  I look at my single friend who just moved to Toronto and is drowning in pussy with his don’t give a fuck attitude. Im not saying that his job title and making 85k a year doesn’t help but, he could be wasting all his money on a wife, but instead is living la vida loca.  Seriously works, created a need for woman to figure out why you’re not acting like all the other guys who shower them with gifts.   Honestly make your life about you, make decisions that benefit yourself, everybody is out there for their own interests. 
Ex3: I was at a party last night with some friends from school. We are all 21/22 years old so have all gone off to university now.   One of my friends I haven't seen for a while tells me that alex is getting married to the girl he was in a relationship with when we were back at school four years ago!   This guy was a perfectly decent bloke with a lot going for him, he was smart and was set to study law at a pretty good university in the uk, she on the other hand is absolutely awful! She always shat all over him, huge strop fits if she didn't get her way, isolated him from everyone (no one had heard from him for two years and one of us gets a text out of the blue saying he's proposed to her).   He used to say what a pain in the arse he was but the story goes that he went to this university, she went with him for his freshers week to ""ensure he didn't meet any girls"" and then she someone convinced him to quit his course and move back to the same dead town we went to school in! She is not at university at all and is not very bright but she managed to grind him down to the point where he asked her to marry him, the guy is 21 years old!  Just a little example of how a relationship can completely ruin your prospects and a man infatuated with one girls pussy will be relationship mince-meat for her to chow down on.  Before the got together she also sucked off a fair few lads so add that on there as well.  Feel sorry for the guy but at the same time he has made his own bed.  Enjoy your Sunday lads
Ex4: Never underestimate the ho within high quality women mates, even when they're of higher socioeconomic status.   A few years ago I was a student at university and had to take trig. Given my past experiences with other professors, I expected this chick would be in her 50's at best. But to my pleasant surprise, first day I walk into her room I discover a hot chick in her late 30's. She looked 29.   I say hello, take my seat and within 5 minutes she begins eye fucking the hell out of me. I mean to the degree that every time I'd looked up she'd be staring. I'm a good looking guy, but I never expected a person of her caliber to flirt with me so obviously. Even others noticed. I mean I literally hadn't said anything but ""hello"". No effort whatsoever.   After a few weeks the entire class began to learn things about each other, including my professor. She would tell us that she's married with 2 kids, etc. She even showed some of us pictures of her family before class would start. Her husband looked like a short beta and had a high quality career. Over time I make her laugh, eye fuck her back, and it officially began building up.   One day, she approaches a table with me and a couple classmates going over some review and she sits right next to me. My classmate directly across from me requested help on a problem, and instead of getting up and walking around the table like anyone else would do, she stands up beside me and bends over putting her ass right next to my face. I knew that was the time to strike.  After class, I wait until everyone leaves and approach her all smooth and to the point and say ""I got time, lets go to your car"". She accepts and we go to her her family's subaru outback with tinted windows and I fuck her brains out.   I ended up passing the class lol.   Moral of the story? Don't ever think that a chick of a higher social status wouldn't fuck someone under them. Never feel intimidated by them and talk to them like you would any other chick on your level. If her husband is cucked enough, she'll find someone who isn't, even if just for a temporary affair with a guy more than 12 years younger.   If you ever have a college professor that's attractive, always keep looking up because you could very well be surprised. Always take advantage.

11,Money,"Ex1: **Summary:**  Why invest in women when all you need is a womb?   **Body:** Hello TRP.  Something has been on mind mind lately.  This sub dose not suffer from a lack of advice along the form of: whatever you do, do not get married.  If you you simply must, whatever you do, don't do it without a prenup.  And even if you get a prenup, whatever you do, do NOT get her pregnant.  Sage advice, both practical and true.   But, it has to be said, that for those with an honest interest in both children and traditional family, this makes for something of a conundrum.  Herein lies my thesis, attempting to reconcile these seemingly, irrational and self-destructive pursuits with the cold litigation-proneness of everyday reality.  Is a relationship, or god forbid, marriage, really a necessary part of this equation?  While women have *in-vitro* fertilization, men suffer from a distinct absence of reproductive independence.  Even with the absence of artificial wombs, removing a woman's uterus without permission for that purpose is probably still illegal in most states, both now, and very likely, forever.   It seems to me that this problem, like all problems, can be solved cheaply, easily, and in questionable quality via outsourcing to China or India.  Perhaps the best options for those with a serious and determined goal of having children is to go to a foreign country where a woman might reasonably value money more than the physical closeness of their offspring.  Pay said woman the average of a year's wage's (roughly 6k in India I think, probably less in rural china) plus medical fees and then go pick up your child, possibly allowing time for breastfeeding.  Have as many as you like, money allowing, and then when you're done: go look for your unicorn.  A unicorn that hopefully isn't terribly attached to the genetic identity of her children.  Or hell, maybe don't bother, just go hire a nanny.   This seems more viable both financially and in terms of finding a woman to suit your needs.  There are of course kinks in this, not the least, being the dietary and physical health of the birth mother during pregnancy, but this could be managed.  In fact, if this practice becomes common spread, perhaps this could lead to the birth of a new industry: free range, organic, kobe womb farms.  I bet there's money to be made.   **Conclusion:**  In terms of pure risk management, separating female commitment and childbearing seems sound.   *PS:* So any takers?  For single fathers here, how is dating/relationships when you have your own kids?  How open are women to raising non related progeny?  Anyone have input on the required finances?
Ex2: Finance is an area in a man's life that shouldn't be about a sage spitting vague advice on top of a mountain, but rather about practical tips based on first hand experience. Unless the guy is trying to sell you some 'get rich quick' method. No one on this forum has this totally figured and there is no universally applicable method.   That being said, I have some money on the side and looking for some non-traditional investment ideas. So What was your best investment in the 0 to 50k€ bracket?  What worked for me in the past:  My best 100€ invested was on website/membership forum I created with a buddy of mine, around something we were passionate about. Returns in the thousands a month at some point. Made me feel cocky enough to leave my job, until we started selling less and I found myself royally fucked, had to sell everything I owned and still ended up homeless and jobless with my career severely hurt. The best part was getting paid to write about something you like. And the huge returns once you ""make it"". Just don't leave your regular job and waste your money.  My best 1000€ investment: was to patent an invention. I am still in the process of producing a prototype so don't have any feedback yet. It could be interesting if it works.  My best 5000€ Investment: Masters degree, hands down.   My best 30000€ investment: Buying a flat is Spain. That's where I would go on vacation anyeay and I rent it to exchange american students for 6 months a year. Somehow risky but Spain's economy is getting better and the only way is up for the future. My advice is to rent to female north-american students, selected through craigslist, instead of local websites. They don't have guarantors thus you can ask for a higher rent but they are generally cleaner, and easier to deal with than boys (fear of being homeless is bigger is my little conjecture). Other places I am considering: Greece: Dirt cheap but higher risk of the country going Mad Max. Bulgaria: Super cheap too. Less risky. On its way to becoming a trendy tourist destination like Croatia.  So let me hear what you have. What's your best Xxx amount of money invested? 
Ex3: ""Man, I'm looking forward to the day my hair grows back to normal!""  If this is you every time after you went to the hairdresser, it is most likely the case that your hairdresser sucks ass. Simple as that. Honestly, I felt the same way every time I got my hair done. But then a thought arised that sounds odd to so many people that I know:   ""Why not invest a little bit more money and find a more expensive hairdresser? Maybe he'll do better work.""  Now, I know what some of you might think when you read the term ""more expensive"". Seriously, throwing away 50 bucks per week to get fucked up at the club? ""Totally fine!"" Buying new clothes on a regular basis that you simply don't need? ""Yeah, why not!?"" Eating a lot of fast food because you're too lazy to cook? ""Ha, sure!""  Investing more than 20 bucks per month to get your hair done? ""FUCK, who do you think I am! Bill MOTHERFUCKING Gates?!""  That's plain childish, but the usual response I receive when I recommend to search for a better hairdresser. The average price for a hairdresser might be around 15€ (around 18$) here. And if you really don't give a shit about your hair at all, you might even get it done with 9€.   Personally, I am investing 25€ (29$) per month in a hairdresser, and it has been one of the best decisions I have ever made. I really don't see why people go batshit crazy when they hear that. People are willing to invest a lot of money in the most useless stuff, but investing like 10€ - 15€ more per month in order to have really nice hair just seems to be completely out of question.   Since I started to go to a better hairdresser, my hair looks sharp throughout the entire time, from the day I go there until the day I go there again. This is simply due to the fact that a hairdresser that gets paid better is capable of taking much more time to get his work done. On the other hand, when you go to one of those fucked up places just to invest as little money as possible, the hairdresser also wants to you to go away as soon as possible because the next 10 customers are already waiting.   Unless you have extremly good hair due to genetics that can't be fucked up anyway, consider going to a more expensive hairdresser and see how it works out. Now, of course you should still try to find a hairdresser with good reviews, plus, make sure that you only pay the money to get your hair done, not some other kind of bullshit like receiving massages or something like that, which is also often included in the programm of ""high-standard-hairdressers"".   TL;DR: Go get a better hairdresser. 
Ex4: The other day a customer was complaining about his wife who spends all his money, regardless on how much he makes. She just spent 150 on scented candles and wanted another 250 for a new vacuum cleaner. She was disappointed when the husband said she'll have to wait until next week. He couldn't understand how could she be so demanding. He makes about double a medium salary, and about 4x a minimum salary. Still, they barely make it to the end of the month.   The guy was out of his mind about this. Why can't we save some of that money? It should make sense to have some money for rainy days, isn't it? But no, she spends it all, and more.  That made me think. There has to be a reason for this behavior.   From what I learned about evolution and red pill theory, there is a reason. She wants your money tied up to her. All surplus has to be spent by her and her children. She can't risk that your extra wealth is used to start a new relationship. Even if all her needs are met and she doesn't really need the scented candles, this way she makes sure it doesn't benefit a potential rival. She risks maybe not having money in a time of need, but that time hasn't come yet and she may find a better option than you when shit hits the fan. And she still may sell the candles, diamonds, jewelry, car and all expensive gifts you bought for her.  The whole economy is based on women spending their husbands' money on useless crap. Ever wondered why? This may be the real reason.  So, working hard to ""earn"" her respect does nothing. It doesn't matter how hard your wheels are spinning, her demands will always be higher than what you can provide. It's up to you to stop her demands and use the money to benefit you. Even if you only use it to save it for rainy days, don't think that she will listen to reason. Control the money, for your sake, and hers. Edit: and, of course, never marry.  Tl;dr: The more you make, the more they spend.

15,Other Social Issues,"Ex1: tldr: Black women are the most masculine women out of all the women i've dealt with.     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROtEft8VC58   In my experience with dealing with women of all different races.  I find that black women are the worst when it comes to displaying feminine characteristics.    As a black man myself, I feel that we as black men have been introduced to feminism early on in our lives.  While feminism is unfortunately growing in popularity, black men have a lot of experience in dealing with this due to the fact that black women tend to be on the extreme side when it comes to this.  Their extreme case of masculinity has to be the biggest turn off when I have to deal with black women.  EDIT: I forgot to mention that I am referring to American black women.  Foreign black women are much more submissive and feminine than the women I mentioned above.   Do you feel that black women are the least feminine?  
Ex2: Last attempt at updating failed because I linked to the previous post. Just search this same title without the ""(Update)"" if you're lost. Or search my post history  -----  **TL;DR** - The officer who made the call did so without authorization. He was a white knight who tried to bait me into going down and incriminating myself. He was suspended without pay for a very short time, and I was told will be under strict monitoring when he returns. The LTR made sure to convey the fact that I did nothing wrong.  -----  So I *did* notice that the voicemail was a little scratchy, like it came from mobile. It didn't come from a landline. I still called the LTR, noticeably pissed.  She insisted she only told them my first name, and she said, ""after I realized the conclusion that they immediately came to when I said we got into a 'fight', I went stone faced and reiterated that you didn't do anything bad"". She said one officer was just jotting things down, and the other was trying to extract more information about me, but she wouldn't budge.  LTR called the station with me on the other line, and had their badge numbers as identification, and once I gave them the number that called me, they confirmed it was the ""interrogator"" officer's cell phone. After a short pause, they said he used his **company computer** to search her Facebook, and get my name. From there, getting my cell number was a piece of cake. The other officer's notes confirm what the LTR said. We actually talked to him on the phone, he said he's been doing this for 20 years, he knows signs when he sees them, and we were good.   The officer was given two week's suspension without pay, and will be on heavy watch when he returns. The LTR and I will both be filling restraining orders against this officer.  This went from a lesson in not trusting women, to always being on the lookout for white knights.
Ex3: Hey Brothers (and sisters)   I have been here in NYC since election night. I thought I'd share some observations and on the ground field research.  http://www.rawlings.com/site-content/gold-glove-gallery.html   I am here working the Rawlings Gold Glove awards.. (crew)... there are some pics on the link. Charlie Sheen/Joe Piscopo and a lot of other absolutely Alpha Bro's not to mention all that testosterone from the 18 best defensive players in Baseball...   So... two blocks down are all the SJW fucks 'protesting' the election.   Tuesday Night: Walked around times square, up and down Fifth avenue, Union Square..... Shock. The quietest I have ever seen NYC. A Few girls are holding up F-Trump signs with the usual boring mono-narrative sexist,racist,xenophobic and ABLEist (new one to me... had to look it up)  Yawwwnnnnn.   Wednesday Night..  Have to walk a maze to get to work from my hotel. Streets are being blocked for 'the protesters""... makes me 15 minutes late to work. I hear the 'protesters' and there is a definite feminine ring to the chants.... I look out the window of the Plaza Hotel... You would have thought it was the suffragettes...80% female, 90% White.     The Crew I was with ran to the windows to flame them and yell ""I voted for him...so what?""  Thursday Night: Protests begin on time like a TV show. Not all Hillary Voters. Just the wealthier ones. Though NYC is one of the most diverse cities in the world, the 'protesters' are overwhelmingly WHITE and FEMALE!!! ?????  Now Laborers,waiters,janitors can't get to work... Mostly foreign born/language speaking males.... Hmmmm???   Friday Night... Awards show goes off great. Total different post. All my childhood heroes. Brooks Robinson is STILL a stud....   Today...off day. Walking the streets, central park, the Plaza.... Long Trails of virtually all white women (with the occasional Mangina) carrying their signs, chanting their BS (My Body, My choice)   **TL;DR**.. A lot of pre-wall white girls gaining attention to support their BP narrative at the expense of working class people of color/foreign born...  they eat their own
Ex4: **TL;DR;** Don't play the White Knight, especially with guns.    Introducing T.J. Antell, RIP the White Knight. TJ. owned a crossfit studio and was well liked enough (lifting folks ?) to be smashing decent pussy(picture provided). He seems have been working on some sort of combo hipster/zero dark thirty delta-force look.   T.J. also decided to get a concealed carry permit and go down to the local Texas Walgreens and live out his Vigilante  Social Justice fantasy. This didn't work out well because:    1. Lots of other people in Texas have guns. 2. His designated Black Knight was done shooting at the presumed princess and so had time to shoot him. 3. There's no Cross Fit or Krav Maga move for being shot in the face by someone who can aim. 4. Risk Reward ratio for being the White Knight is ~infinity.    TJ thought he was ""The Punisher"" and was restoring Truth, Justice and the American Way. Now instead of laying out gym bunnies and enjoying the burn like Chad, he's laying in a drawer in the local morgue. His SO wins the pity Olympics though. And the state of Texas will be spending $1000k on prosecuting and locking up the Black Knight (no pun intended), who has gone from ankle shooter to killer.  **Don't be T.J**    [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/05/03/he-thought-he-could-help-concealed-carry-gun-wielder-intervenes-in-domestic-dispute-and-is-shot-dead/?tid=pm_national_pop_b]
