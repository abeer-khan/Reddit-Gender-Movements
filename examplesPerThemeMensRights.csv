2,Relationships,"Ex1: i am a  number  - year - old guy and my dad just beat me repeatedly in the face . as i am not underage and not a girl , can i even go to the police with this ? my dad just beat me up about  number  hours ago and my face is still slightly bleeding . if you are curious why , i finally admitted to him i have been dating a guy and he got really angry . i am still living with him and i am staying over at a friends now . can i go to the police with this ? i live in a very traditional town and i feel like they would just laugh at me for being a pussy . can anything be done ?
Ex2:   lpt   - if you find yourself lacking companionship in your life get yourself a dog instead of a girlfriend . there seems to be a lot of lonely men out there that are lacking companionship in life and with the ever increasing list of demands women have in their "" partners "" a lot of men are upset at spending life alone .   but   the answer to that is simple - get yourself a dog ! preferably if you can rescue / adopt a dog from a shelter . i used to be upset years ago that i was alone but then i adopted my dog when i saw a shared facebook post that my local shelter could only keep him for a week before he would be put down and my happiness dramatically increased ! * dogs are loyal . they will always be there for you when you get home . * dogs are not judgemental . they do not care what you look like , how much money you , how nice your house is etc they just care about you . * dogs are always happy to see you and they love company . do not spend life alone , rescue a dog ! save one dog ' s life and enrich your own !
Ex3: and just like that , with no physical evidence , i am dating a   rso   . how do i support him ? my boyfriend ( 2 8 m ) was falsely accused of sexual misconduct by a mentally unstable , verbally abusive former student . via email communications , she manipulated my boyfriend into picking her up from school without her parent ' s permission . she basically threatened to kill herself if he did not help her . it was all a ruse to get him to meet her .   she was upset because he was dating me , and it was an elaborate plot . the second he dropped her off she accused him of touching her inappropriately . he was charged with several crimes , all carrying long jail sentences and sex offender registration . we can not afford a private attorney , and his po has negotiated an "" excellent deal "" that avoids jail time , but has him registering for fifteen years . apparently , complete lack of physical evidence that he did something wrong means nothing . also , the fact that the girl has been hospitalized   numerous   times and has a history of sexual misconduct herself also means nothing . his relationship history and standing in the community cannot be used as a defense . basically , he ' s fucked . her testimony is enough to convict him . how do i help him pick up the pieces of his life ? i live far away and will not even see him for five months ( i accepted a year - abroad position a month before this nightmare began ) . he can not visit me because the country i am currently residing in turns rsos away at the gate . thanks , adam walsh . how are these laws even legal ? how do i support him ? i cannot handle him hurting himself . i am trying . i am his advocate . and i do not know what to do . note : coming home early , while so enticing , is not an option . he has debts he needs help paying off and it may take time for him to reestablish himself . we need my income .
Ex4: [ marraige ] wife and i had a fight the other day my wife told me tonight very matter of factly and flat out that she was ready and willing to knock me out and kick my ass on saturday when we had an argument . she had even shoved me a few times and said she was hoping i ' d push her back so she ' d have an excuse .   then talked about how i would not have stooda chance and how she out a girl in a coma for a week once . she ' s never talked to me like this before , and i am kinda .   scared .   she ' s bigger than me and stronger .   but she sounded .   amused when she told me .

------------------------------

Ex1: fathers , how sick and tired are you of your contributions to the family unit being completely shrugged off ? i am sort of sick of seeing this shit considering my dad worked his   ass   off to make sure me and my family had a comfortable life . not to say my mom did not work her ass off either , but both my parents contributed greatly to my childhood , and yet it ' s my mom who only gets the credit . are you fathers out there sort of sick of this ?
Ex2: state of america ' s fathers - inaugural report men - care . org has just released a  number  page report on the state of fatherhood in the us . last year they did one on fathers worldwide . the web site has a bunch of infographics , and this link to download the full report :   men - care . org advocate around the world for paternity leave and against gender stereotyping .
Ex3: men , when have you felt most powerless because you are male ? not my best example but i was in   usa   and a group of us were discussing mothers day . i was saying that not necessarily all mothers are great and worthy of much celebration and that , without good parenting , being a mother can simply be because of biology . a girl across the table from me who i did not know and had said nothing then threw her beer at me . with one hand on my beer and my other arm in a sling i could not defend myself .
Ex4: father ' s rights advocate yesterday at my family court hearing , my soon to be ex wife had a women ' s shelter advocate as part representation , in addition to attorney . the advocate did not say anything other than her name to the court . .   this got me thinking .   is there such thing as a father ' s rights advocate ? or , how do i go about becoming one ? i am in minnesota . this whole process is slanted against men , let alone great dads that want to be there for their kids .

------------------------------

Ex1: just got falsely accused of rape at a family party and physically assaulted . what do i do now ? my best friend now doubts my integrity even though we have been friends since forever . i do not know what the first step to defend myself is . can i get some guidance i am a little shocked right now . the alleged rape happened  number  years ago . i was attacked by the father . i am a canadian national with no criminal record and i have have not had any contact with this girl whatsoever . update : friend just contacted me saying the alleged story had more holes than swiss and that he was sorry for what happened . still looking at legal recourses for the allegations and attack .
Ex2: regret is not rape . ( unless you are a woman ) so a few years ago i briefly dated this girl . i will call her j . during the time we dated she told me about some of her wild teenage antics , including the time she and one of her friends ( they were both  number  ) fucked a local business owner and his wife after smoking a bunch of meth with them . fast forward a few years and now she ' s claiming that she and her friend were raped by this guy and that they were unable to give consent because of their age and the fact that they were on meth . i know legally  number  is a minor , ( in my state ) but these girls knew exactly what they were doing . they decided to trade sex for drugs . because of this whole  hashtag  me too   movement women are doing mental gymnastics in order to jump on this victim train .
Ex3: after seeing how much a false rape accusation ruined my friends life i can not never blindly side with the accusor ever again my friend had been in a toxic relationship with this girl for three years . she was problematic , selfish , childish , and really judgmental of the people he got close to . she had no desire to be better or improve and he finally broke it off with her and moved on with his life . i was so happy for him at the time . i found out later on he was still talking to her all the time and they were still really close despite him supposedly dropping her ass . this led to them having sexual intercourse again a few weeks later which almost led to his downfall . she had a new boyfriend she wasn ' t telling him about and he came across some texts she sent a girlfriend of hers saying that she fucked my friend . to protect herself and with no empathy for how it ' d impact his life she claimed he raped her . her new boyfriend went and blasted him all over social media for this . people he knew for years abandoned him without even hearing his side of the story . i saw him called names i feel no one deserves . he was depressed for months and even tried to off himself . he was only saved because the friend of the girl came out against her after that and showed that she said it was consensual . one little lie could have destroyed everything he was and wanted to be in life . and even though it was debunked people are always going to be more weary around him despite being a truly kind soul . i know it ' s shitty but after that i could never listen to the just the accuser ' s side and decide it was true ever again . when things like this happen i wonder how anyone could but that ' s just the victim culture world we live in .

Ex1: humble bundle men ' s charities i feel like a discussion should be made about the humble bundle store place . as someone who makes a lot of purchases on there i feel like it ' s about time to choose the right charity to send my money , and i feel like that money is best placed in something i believe in . there are so many choices on my website but since i am not in the us or   uk i   have no idea which ones are good and reputable . it would be great to know which charities are reputable when it comes to actually using the funds and using them equally . any information would be amazingly helpful , thank you .
Ex2: mother makes obvious attempt to extort money from father . feminist media all to happy to help . when a person wants a  money  and over  percent  increase a month in child support and she most probably makes jack shit , would not the first question you ' d ask be how the hell are you making ends meet right now ? sounds to me she ' s trying to make the case do not look at this . he ' s a shit dad so you should take away his money and give it to me .   msn   just wants to help her out .   the commenters are smarter than the reporter .
Ex3: yahoo ’ s marissa mayer to make  money  million from verizon deal - will there be an outcry over the high payment ? [ article \ ( paywall \ ) ] (   * from the article  kiss> > marissa mayer to make  money  million from verizon deal . the hefty pay out comes despite ms . mayer ’ s inability to accomplish what she was hired to do five years ago : revitalize the fading internet icon following its struggles with high employee and executive turnover and declines in ad revenue . > instead , yahoo sold its business — not including some assets like its stakes in other internet companies — to verizon last year for  money  billion . > for ms . mayer , that includes stock options valued at more than  money  million and restricted - stock units worth about  money  million at the current share price of  money  . she also holds about  number  million yahoo shares , worth nearly  money  million . together , those amounts are worth  money  million at the current share price , according to the information in the filing . the figure doesn ’ t include salary , bonus or options she has already exercised . according to a quick [ payscale . com ] (   search the average salary at yahoo is approx .  money  / year ( being generous here ) . mayer is therefore making 1 5 0 0 x as much for selling this company than the average employee makes per year . something tells me that we will be hearing praise for her efforts as a strong female   ceo   vs . the usual outrage over high   ceo   compensation .  
Ex4: uk tax disparity . yet the uk government spends about four times as much on women ' s health than men ' s; and eight times as much on research into women ' s cancers as men ' s . in the  number  /  number  tax year , men paid  money  billion of the government ’ s  money  billion income tax receipts (  percent  ) , while women paid  money  billion (  percent  ) . the figures don ’ t add up to exactly  percent  because of some crude rounding in the income tax receipts stats , leading to a discrepancy of  money  million . the bottom line ? in  number  /  number  men paid  money  billion more income tax than women , a new record .
Ex5: canadian association for equality : ottawa centre fundraising campaign raises over  money  i was notified of this via their email correspondence list , but did not see a posting on their site : > we are pleased to announce that when our campaign ended on  date  , we had surpassed even this objective , with a final tally of  money  ! > we have signed a lease for our venue in ottawa and we are interviewing candidates for the position of executive director at this time . the grand opening is planned for  date  so mark your calendars now . > on behalf of the   cafe   board of directors , we want to extend our appreciation and congratulations to the amazing team in ottawa for their hard work , patience and unrelenting dedication to this cause . > we also want to express our deepest thanks to each of you for your financial contributions , which will translate directly into families receiving the help they desperately need , in many cases for the first time . > in the coming weeks you will get to hear directly from members of the ottawa team with updates and new developments as we prepare to open the canadian centre for men and families in the nation ' s capital ! > justin trottier
Ex6: burger king ' s "" pink tax fries "" is another example of how one - sided the narrative of gender equality is . so [ this ] (   is a story trending now , burger king launches new fries and has something of a "" promotion "" where they have a special pink box that costs extra . the idea is to raise awareness of the "" pink tax "" , which refers to higher prices for "" womens items "" such as women ' s razors . to me , it ' s so one sided because things like this always ignore the examples where men pay more or are disadvantaged : - men pay more for car insurance , sometimes by hundreds   of dollars - men are the ones who are drafted a die - men receive far less benefit from tax paid programs , services , healthcare , etc but slightly more expensive razors is considered an example of sexism . it may seem like a small thing , but it is a manifestation of the larger general lack of awareness society has for the many double standards against men .

------------------------------

Ex1: divorce is worse than rape at least with rape there ' s closure . alimony and child support are fo -   evah   you lose half ( or more ) of everything you own . then you have to watch as another man hangs out with your kids , drives around in what was your car , live in your old house and fucks your ex wife . then you drive home in your used corolla to a one bedroom apartment in a bad part of town to sleep on a crappy mattress on the floor completely alone fearing how you are going to pay for their lives and have nightmares of what they are doing while you suffer . this is not always the case but it is very common ( and is the actual story of my now suicidal uncle ) .
Ex2: divorce not final , wife pregnant by another man my wife and i have a signed and notarized separation agreement that lays out the grounds for our separation . one of which is her being on my company health insurance plan . she informed me yesterday that she is pregnant with her boyfriends baby and he has forced her to stop working , he does not know she has her insurance through me and that she will not be able to pay the weekly premium that is deducted from my paycheck . also , according to the insurance provider i would be responsible for any unpaid bills relating to the pregnancy and i cannot remover her from the policy . also , in north carolina , even though we have been separated since december , because our divorce is not final , it is presumed by law that the child is mine . i have an attorney doing some research but i want opinions please !   update   ! spoke with the attorney and did some research , i am able to drop her from the insurance , and i will have to have a   dna   test done as well as a signed affidavit stating that he is the father and then i am off the hook !
Ex3: mens role in marriages i was raised to be told that in marriages , we are equal , if there are problems , we should seek counselling and compromise . yet i feel like society is always siding with the woman and not listening to the men opinions . directly demonizing the man the instant they have an opinion on anything that goes against the women within the marriage . once my wife says "" im tired "" , all my opinions are thrown out of the window and everyone advice becomes biased towards the tired one . no one cares if men are tired because we are strong beings . i despise any man with power that would hurt a women . yet somehow i feel like now is a bad time to be born a man . when i seek advice on my marriage this is how i feel . if i am wrong , so be it , but do not need to talk to me as if i am a demon for having an opinion . anyone else feels this way ?
Ex4: michael combes interview with marine vet and divorced father scott momper - on male disposability , divorce and child custody . michael combes is a documentarian who is currently working on a film called "" cash and prizes . "" this is his interview with scott momper of warriorsforfreedom . org , talking about male disposabilty , the current state of veterans in the us and the divorce racket . [

Ex1: feminism in relationships / a hard breakup story .   i have been a long time lurker on this sub and i have taken a lot of good things from this sub . but let us get into it .   i have been in a relationship for about a year now and it steadily started to decline about a  number  months ago . we stopped going on dates , she started working more hours , becoming more and more unavailable during our planned days off and just simply not interested anymore . well last night it all came out . after a post christmas rock and roll christmas concert she told me she wanted to break up because i am not on board with her and her opinions on feminism .   just that   . nothing else . now do not get me wrong . i do believe in equality between males and females . i believe in compromise . i tried to explain why i am not into feminism like she is and of course she kept saying that because i believe in equality i am a feminist . that ' s where i started to prove her wrong and quoting a few rad fems and explaining also why the reason i am not a feminist is much like i am an atheist . because there are some bad apples in every bunch and i ' d rather stand on my own rather than side by side with those bad apples . she did not get it we are still broken up .   so here i am .   drunk at work trying to roll a few good looking omelets and writing this .   can someone help me try to work this out ? or help me say something to her that ' ll break this tension of opinions ?
Ex2: feminization of workplace culture , oppression of men stats and strategies please ? i am really tired of the feminization of culture in general and the prevalence of sexual rhetoric in the workplace . i am a man that wants a normal life , to work with people who are good at what they do and live my life the way i see fit . why is it okay to shame , degrade , denigrate men these days ? looking for advice , statistics , facts from the community that could help ?
Ex3: feminism and its purpose ? i have been thinking about the women and few guys who make up the current 3 rd wave of feminists . why are they against men ? maybe it has something to do with their upbringing , maybe they got rejected by a guy ( "" nice guy situation "" ) or maybe they are ostracized ? i do not see the need of feminism today as it already served its purpose of giving women rights . so what are the current feminists trying to achieve ?
Ex4: dear feminists , the anti - abortion movement is mostly made up of women . it ' s not so much men telling you what to do with your bodies , but other women . go to any pro - life event and you will see mostly women there with their babies . just thought i ' d like to make that clear as i see shit like this on / r / feminism :

------------------------------

Ex1: bringing men ' s rights to the third world . hi broz . i have been thinking about stuff lately . i have read that the men ' s rights movement is catching on in india to some degree . that ' s good . how many other places in the third world have a local   mrm   ? i apologize if the term "" third world "" is offensive but i think you all know what i mean . food for thought : if the concept of men ' s rights is different from patriarchy then the third world could use men ' s rights because those countries are certainly patriarchal . furthermore , feminism is a global movement at this point , so the   mrm   will need to go global in order to compete . in some african countries , male homosexuality is illegal but female homosexuality is okay . that ' s messed up .
Ex2: any places for uk mras ? i am from southern england and i am relatively new to the men ' s rights movement . i ' d love to meet other like - minded people and discuss these issues with people , but i am having an incredibly difficult time finding any uk based men ' s rights groups or services . i know this is a minuscule and widely disliked movement , thanks to the popularity of feminism , but is there really nowhere in england for me to meet others or partake in activism ? it ' s quite frustrating .
Ex3: rant : i have a love - hate relationship with this subreddit these days , i try to stay away from this subreddit because all this news of blatant systematic misandry pisses me off . i am never in a good mood ever since i discovered the   mrm   and the injustices we face . i am  percent  an   mra   , but all these depressing news and statistics has not been good for me because they have resulted in me being in a shitty mood most of the time . it is unhealthy to be angry all the time , and being involved in this movement and constantly being slapped in the face with injustice did exactly that to me . what pisses me off even more is the feel of powerlessness , the vast majority of society has been brainwashed by feminism . our issues are largely being ignored , and everyone assumes we are privileged . what is the point of our activism if we know we will never win ? no progress has been made so far , and i highly any progress will ever be made . as shitty as this sounds , sometimes i wish i had never discovered mens rights . no infuriating statistics , no rage inducing stories of false rape accusations , no examples of female criminals getting the pussy pass etc . ignorance is truly bliss , now that i am aware of female privilege i can not just forget about it . i am thinking about taking a short break from this   mra   stuff .  
Ex4:   cbc   reporting that toronto mass killer was "" incel "" who admired elliot rodgers - - prepare for a thousand articles falsely conflating   mra   ' s with incels a young man just drove a rental van into a crowd of people in toronto , killing at least ten and wounding several others . victims were randomly chosen . supposedly he posted messages online about the "" incel rebellion "" and "" overthrowing the chads and stacys "" . so typical incel silliness . [ edit : just to clear , nothing has been proven yet - - for all we know this could be a hoax ] an "" expert "" was invited on to discuss "" angry young men "" who hate "" women and feminism "" because they "" feel entitled to sex "" ( apparently most women suffer from internalized misogyny , as the majority do not identify as feminist ) . only a few months ago the   cbc   invited on a gender studies professor to discuss the documentary "" the red pill "" . she was either completely clueless or a flat our liar , as she claimed   mra   ' s "" think women owe them sex because it is their natural right . "" i have never seen a single   mra   make such a claim or even be interested in that sort of stuff . i mean the men ' s rights movement was started by fathers wanting to see their children for god ' s sake . anyway just wanted to give everyone a heads up . prepare for a thousand articles conflating   mra   ' s with incels and a thousand more on "" toxic masculinity . "" might be a good idea to counter this bullshit in comments sections online . this is an information war , and many feminists will not hesitate to lie in service of their religion .

------------------------------

Ex1: wage gap ! ok , i know the wage gap controversy proposing that men make on average a certain amount more than women do has been debunked . that it has been chalked up to difference in experience or other factors . but anytime the argument arises there is always a female or two set on the idea that it still exists . well , i am on mobile so i will not be posting sources or anything . everything i say can be looked up by googling though . i was under the impression that everyone of equal rank in the military made the same amount . if their situations were similar . married , single , hazard pay .   to my surprise , i found that women actually make more than men in the military due to an allowance issued to everyone for maintaining their uniforms . this allowance is called   cma   or clothing maintenance allowance . myself and all other males receive roughly  number  bucks a month for it , while all females receive roughly  number  bucks a month . making equally qualified and ranked females earn roughly  number  more dollars in a  number  year career . now i am not upset about earning  number  less , i am upset that even while they make more , they still get behind the concept of a wage gap in our favor . the times have changed . women have all the same rights as men , and now some that men do not have . yet i still get treated like a make in the 6 0 s did . when is someone going to stand up and say that women are treated better ? when will it be okay for me to feel oppressed ? i already have a documented smaller chance of acceptance into the officer corpse for being a white male than a female , and a much lower chance than say a female of minority . but all these things hide behind fancy names like affirmative action and needed for diversity . when wil the best possible job applicant get the job based on qualification over race or gender ? end rant . sorry if this is not the correct forum or format for this type of thing , i just feel like this is the only place i can say this without being persecuted as someone who hates women . which i do not . i just wish they would stop hating me for unfounded reasons .
Ex2:   stem   disparity caused by economic factors , not socialization . [ post  number  months ago about norwegian gender paradox ] (   apparently according to the same institute that got its funding cut after harald ela finished his documentary "" brainwash "" , the   stem   gap is caused by economic factors . women have been getting into   stem   , but men have not been going into pink collar occupations . women also avoid   stem   because they want to spend more time on their families . this is because   stem   , unlike pink collar jobs , tends to be much less flexible . explains why women leave   stem   as well . whether this is because of socialization is unknown . quite the about face . [ here ' s the link ] (  
Ex3: my anti - man family so i am just venting here , but let me just say that regardless of political affiliation i still love my family to death , not to say they are not blind sometimes . so me and my aunt got pretty into it on snapchat about women ' s issues and stupid shit like that . she directed me to all these buzzfeed articles ( "" it ' s unbiased news , honey "" ) that obviously supported her side and made ridiculously false claims . i wanted to seriously school her , like i would on anyone else who says white boys are a problem , you know ? i did not just because i do not want family gatherings to be awkward . she also brought up how apparently taking birth control is oppression , even though men have to wear an uncomfortable condom for the entire time . she makes all these laughable arguments like the wage gap and how women apparently have to be on the watch for rapists  number  /  number  . dude , you do not know how fuckin bad i wanted to go off , "" well , bitch , the wage gap does not take into account .   "" you know ? she sure did not know what to say about our sexual assault argument . i obviously said that it is a serious issue , but it is not a pandemic for women like she is making it sound . the ironic thing here is that i , a teenage boy , have been a victim of sexual assault , and she has not . i was molested when i was a young boy ( still not a feminist , and rooted for kavanaugh ) . there ' s another thing though . she always brings out the age card . all the "" oh honey , you are too young to know what you are talking about . "" yeah , she said that . well , joke ' s on her because i am  number  years younger than her and know far more about politics than she could ever dream of knowing . damn , men need some recognition for shit like this like now .

------------------------------

Ex1: is there a gender divide between men and women in the west ? i currently live in a country in asia . our men and women are very traditionally minded . us men doing men thing and women , while there are many of them in   stem   fields and pretty independent , their goal is still getting married and having children . feminism is pretty much non - existing even if i have to admit our society gives in a bit towards women , but i am not complaining since they actually appreciate it instead of screaming bloody hellhound but on your side , i see nothing but circus acts everywhere . the women , especially feminists wanting to ban anything that exists . everything is racist , everything is sexist , everything is homophobic . movies , games , tv shows , bathroom , air conditioner , nanotechnology , pencil , diamond , condom , .   just literally everything can be made into a problem if the feminists tweet hard enough . on the men side , we have   mgtow   , red pill and some sexist , not all , mras . the crazies on each side are driving the rational ones away from each other . now the women are complaining there are no good men left while the men just keep going from girl to girl and playing video games . might as well keep the two sides separated so no problem will arise . this is not how i imagine the first world west supposed to be if this post is a bit offensive or childish , i apologize . i just need a bit of room to vent
Ex2: thank you great women and men who spoke up for male victims . on international women ' s day i would like to thank great women and men who publicly stood up for male victims of discrimination and abuse ! i am grateful to karen straughan for her great videos , to cassie jaye for "" the red pill "" film , to deepika bhardwaj for "" martyrs of marriage "" film , to christina marie hoff sommers for bringing the issues men face to a very wide audience , to janet bloomfield , hannah wallen , alison trump ladin ( typhonblue ) for raising awareness of the issues . i am also grateful to sargon of akkad and paul elam for bringing public awareness to the issues men face . in fact , millions of men and hundreds of thousands of women in   usa   are aware of the oppression men face but most are afraid to speak up in wide forums . in fact without exaggeration , over  percent  of us are afraid to speak to a wide audience due to gender feminist bullying . like  percent  of people i have no wide audience .
Ex3: i am in love with a feminist , and we are going to watch the red pill at some point . i have never seen it . i need guidance . rag on me all you want , folks , but i love her . she does try to differentiate herself from "" feminazis "" , she herself even uses the word . she ' s supportive of men ' s reproductive rights , draft equality in a shaky way , domestic violence shelter equality , sex abuse treatment equality , and a good number of other things . we have had some more heated discussion about things and she is generally supportive with men ' s struggles but in disbelief that modern feminism is completely antagonistic in them . the only thing that really waves a huge red flag to me about serious indoctrination is that she believes in the wage gap . i try not to get into it with her , but that ' s not what i aim to talk about . i love this woman , she ' s said she will watch the documentary with me but i am worried . what are the contents like ? she ' s not very averse to controversy but i am just hoping it ' s not focused on finger - wagging at women like literally everything feminism spawns . sure , it ' s no big deal if it makes mention of female privilege and whatnot , but i just do not want her to feel like she ' s being dragged through the mud and i am supposed to get some kind of weird smug hard - on or something .
Ex4: in red pill swallowing , did femtheist devine swallow the red pill or is this the world ' s biggest   cya   ? does anyone know if this is this the same person ? for those unfamiliar with the femthiest devine , she advocated reducing men to  percent  of the population , imposing a national castration day , and reducing men to "" breeding stock "" essentially sex slaves to women . some of her youtube stuff might still be out there . i was looking for her original web site , but do not see it ( it might be archived somewhere if you want to look ) , but here is a link to the forgetten history of misandry entry for her .   it was even reported that she faked her death .   there was talk at one point of her having issues finding a job because of the stuff she put out there so maybe it ' s a way of reinventing herself . i am not convinced that she ' s a friend of the   mrm   , but i do see a bit of pro - men things on her new site and people change .   can anyone make heads or tails of this ?

------------------------------

Ex1: just some thoughts i am a male and supporter of egalitarianism and i like most of what i see on this sub . it seems like over here we are a lot more open to dissenting opinions than other subs which i will not bother to name . however sometimes i worry when something here that is an outright attack on women or is clearly false is highly upvoted and very few people call it out . my fear is not that people ' s feelings are going to get hurt , but rather that if we allow people on our sub claiming to be   mra   ' s to say hateful things about women , it will invalidate our movement and will lead to the rest of our good points / arguments / issues being ignored . i think we need to remember we are simply fighting for equality - we must remember we are not a women / feminist hate club . let me know what you think .
Ex2: i talked about men ' s rights on / r / twoxchromosomes . my experience . my post was deleted . you know , i wasn ' t expecting anything else , but goddamn . i mentioned how i was a  number  year old female   mra   , and i got called a liar , whiny redpiller loser . i am gonna take some screenshots and post here . there were some who asked good questions and a really nice person in the comments , but support for my ideas were few and far between . i want to thank all the people on here for being a lot more loving , accepting and rational than any feminist i have ever met . i have not posted here that much but i really love this sub . we got a long fight before we can truly create a marketplace where men ' s human dignity is respected , but the censorship and ridicule i have experienced has made me even more determined .
Ex3: opinion : this sub is turning into r / sjwhate do not get me wrong i have nothing against that sub but i feel that for this sub it should be returned to have a greater focus on men ' s issues , rather than just anything antifeminist . i am not against antifeminism and it is definitely necessary in order to promote equal rights for men but it ' s not the be all and end all of men ' s rights . this may just me being pedantic but i think it makes it harder to claim to be fighting for legitimate issues when it is diluted by pedantic hand wringing .
Ex4: how to combat r / againstmensrights hello everyone , i don ’ t post much ,   mra   lurker here . i like reading this sub and informing myself . the claims that this subreddit is fueled by hate is asinine . it ’ s full of support and care . my question for everyone is how do we combat this and show the world our concerns are genuine and warranted ? people come here , read , and are free to form their own opinions i get that . but aside from the active   mra   commenting on other subs , how can we start more dialogue with feminists ? poking fun or pointing out contradiction from afar is easy ( both us and them ) how do we have more serious dialogue ?

------------------------------

Ex1: i am not sure we should see the call to draft women as a true victory for gender equality . i am not sure this should be celebrated as a "" victory "" for equality . to me , the true victory for citizen ' s rights is when there is not a draft to register for at all . just a reminder that our goals are to solve men ' s specific problems , not make things "" as bad "" for women . we want what ' s best for everyone , one reason i always feel the   mrm   is the best moral philosophy i have ever encountered .
Ex2: reminder to my canadian men ! write to your ministers and demand that the income tax act stop discriminating against single father ' s , demand equal rights to claim your children , and equal rights to the   ccb   .   demand the repeal of ""  number  ( f ) where the qualified dependant resides with the dependant ’ s female parent , the parent who primarily fulfils the responsibility for the care and upbringing of the qualified dependant is presumed to be the female parent ""  
Ex3: trying to be equal when job hiring . how ? i was having a discussion with a friend about hiring people at a job interview . the issue : there are two perfectly equal candidates to a job . equal on skill , professionalism , workplace culture fit . one candidate happens to be female , the other male . which one to choose ? my answer was to provide additional interviews and skill based questions as tie breakers . my friend says to automatically hire the female because statistically females have had it harder then men . and that this logic shows equality . looking for thoughts or counters on former / latter or both mindsets .
Ex4: outspoken in sociology class because i supported gender equality someone made the comment : “ the world would be a better place if it were run by women ” i responded it would be better if it were controlled equally by the genders . apparently that ’ s not good enough because men have been running the world for too long and thus we must reverse the inequality . i never thought i ’ d ever need to defend equality publicly .
Ex5: absolutely , there is sexism against women yep . sexist male attitudes against women have meant we have been too easy and soft on them for too long . we have got to stop letting women win arguments , especially about the patriarchy , just because they are women . by not actually challenging them to produce clear evidence and rationale , we have allowed too many of them to develop sloppy thinking ( viewpoints that have not had to stand up to close scrutiny ) . it is deeply unfair of us . it really is a consequence of sexism against women - we should be treating them as equals and helping to stand up against the fanatics in their midst . their woman ' s studies groups - now often rebranded as gender studies - is rife with idealogues who are immune from the robust challenges of serious male - dmoniated academia because few men join them , and when they do , they better tow the line of the echo chamber , or they will learn the depth of "" hell hath no fury .   "" . so , it ' s allowed them to get away with decades of group think , which is now washing over to society in general . one challenge to stand up to now is that of the pay gap and the socialist call for equal outcomes . can not fix one gap without addressing all the others that stand against men . if men were equally likely to win custody battles , there would be more women forced into battling along in their careers to pay child support ( as men have had to do , forcing them to fight for promotions and a raise ) , so correcting one gap would help to correct the other . but can not do this when the toxic feminist narrative is it ' s always the fault of the patriarchy ( actually , it is , since male dominated law set up these systems to benefit women ) and men can never be right and women can never be wrong - their feminist sites are about equality , no matter how many women there are really just bitching about all men ; and our manosphere is always misogyny , no matter how man men like me are just here to raise genuine points . too many men let women get away with this . time to let women know , if they are indeed equal to us , what a true battle of ideologies is like before the extremes of ideology win .

Ex1: looking for mcdowell ' s  number  study i am trying to find an electronic copy of mcdowell ' s  number  study entitled false allegations , published in forensic science digest . i have tried every combination of keywords with google , but i can not seem to come up with a like to the actual study . does anyone have a link to this ? for reference : mcdowell , c . p .

Ex2: canada elbowgate the fact that this was a scandal is a   big   problem in this country people are making light of it and do not realize how it shows perfectly the amount of political correctness gone wild here . this is why the claims of abuse have skyrocketed during divorce . it is now a tactic to cry abuse to get your way if you are a woman in canada . it has become so prevalent that they have set up a trial court in t.o. to address both matters at once on a trial basis . i guess people will just keep laughing as man after man is thrown in jail and stripped of his possessions .   fun fact   in ontario an "" investigation "" is considered completed after the mere at of interviewing the "" person "" making the allegations . next step arrest and charges .   not so fun fact   . the actual definition of the word . in · ves · ti · ga · tion inˌvestəˈɡāsh ( ə ) n / noun the action of investigating something or someone ; formal or systematic examination or research .

Ex3: studies that indicate male gender is an indication of statistically higher intelligence . i ' d like to present a selection of publications for the purpose of discussion and debate on the nature of data and publication . a common tactic of sjws here on reddit and elsewhere - especially in the antimra subs - is to attack any logical argument with demands for a source , then to attack any sources provided . at the same time they find any publication that either supports their narrative , or that they can misconstrue into supporting their narrative , or , mostly common , simply lie and claim the study says something it does not . so , i ' d like to present a little experiment . below are  number  studies conducted by reputation and qualified researchers using the scientific method and published in reputable sources . the data in all  number  of these sources support the claim that male gender is a factor of higher intelligence , and men are naturally more intelligent than women , or at the very least , score higher on tests of intelligence that are considered standard by qualified academics and doctors in the field of psychology .         now , the conclusion of these studies are either true , or they are not . if they are not true , than that calls into question the validity of any study , even if from a reputable source , as a study from qualified researchers conducted using the scientific method can still be wrong , and i ' d be very interested to hear an explanation from anti - mras who use feminist - leaning publications to attempt to debunk our claims and support their own . if they are   true , and males are , on average , more intelligent , then let us just say i ' d be even more interesting in hearing an explanation from feminists and sjws . just a stimulating post for the morning ! hope you enjoy .
Ex4:   psa   : these two links to studies are all you need to completely and concisely disprove the entire modern feminist ideology     i am surprised i do not see these used more - they can be used to disprove basically anything a feminist says , since all their ideas arise from the belief that men are biased against women and in favor of other men . also , people need to more often explain how societal gender roles before the industrial revolution and birth control were the only way that was actually possible on a wide scale , rather than being "" oppression "" . these are the two most important arguments . everyone needs to use them , all the time . they are the two biggest reasons why the modern feminist ideology makes no sense at all to anyone with basic common sense , but most people do not seem to know how to articulate these ideas . this needs to change . edit : here ' s another study that ' s similarly useful , thanks to / u / iainmf

Ex1: an objective book about the suffragettes is there a good and objective book about the suffragettes ? something that wont make them look like the heroes they never were but also not condemn them all together . additional question : what exactly do we know about e . pankhursts understanding of equal rights ? was she really interested in getting the vote for   all   women , or as some have stated , only for women of her own standing , class and upbringing , and not for the chambermaid with a small income ?
Ex2: misandry from donald trump i feel like we have heard a lot from feminists about every arguably misogynist thing donald trump or anyone associated with him has said or done . however , what has not been discussed is his and his associates ' misandrist statements and actions . during the campaign donald said that [ he believes "" women are generally better than men "" ] (   he has also suggested that [ men are prone to rape women if given any opportunity ] (   more recently his lawyer [ said outright ] (   > "" jared is a fine man , you know that , "" the former new york mayor said . "" men are disposable . "" > "" but a fine woman like ivanka ? come on . "" i am sure i could dig around for more and i will at some point but i feel like it ' s pretty clear that contrary to what feminists say donald trump is not representing men or mras in any way and in fact he seems to agree with at least some of the more female supremacist feminists . edit : also wanted to add [ republican and trump ' s attempts to remove men from the welfare system ] (  
Ex3: hillary clinton attacks "" bernie bros "" in new book "" some of his supporters , the so - called bernie bros , took to harassing my supporters online , ” anyone who paid attention at the time knows that the "" bernie bros "" meme was entirely made up . probably by pr hacks working for clinton . it was a lame gamer gate style smear designed to portray hillary ' s opponents as sexist . if anyone was "" harassing "" political opponents it was the paid trolls at "" correct the record "" , hillary ' s online propaganda machine . and what the fuck is it with feminists adding the word "" bro "" to everything they dislike ? bro used to be a term men used to communicate friendship and solidarity . feminists hijacked it and turned it into a pejorative . i also noticed they prefer using the word "" dude "" rather than man . it ' s all so fucking juvenile .
Ex4: after women got the right to vote , why did not they demand the responsibility to be drafted into war ? why did only tens of millions of teenage boys have to die horrible deaths in ww2 ? in korea ? in vietnam ? if i were born in the 1 9 2 0 s i would have gladly given up my right to vote if it meant i could stay home and take care of the kids . it beats getting my legs and arms blown off in combat or being dissected alive in some   pow   camp in a far away jungle . even to this day ,  number  years since universal suffrage it is still only men who are required by law to sign up for the selective service . why have not they demanded equality ? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ""   register   : it ’ s what a man ’ s got to do . it ’ s quick , it ’ s easy , it ’ s the law .

4,Health / Abuse,"Ex1: taylor & johnson debunk rape hysteria again taylor & johnson consistently fight for men ' s rights in matters of ( false ) campus rape accusations . just recently :   & nbsp ; earlier :           & nbsp ; while mr cannot be strongly partisan , i note that liberal media ( such as   nyt   and wapo and huffpo ) consistently advance the hysteria , while conservative media consistently publish articles ( as taylor & johnson ' s ) debunking the hysteria .
Ex2: looking statistics on prison rape . i was listening to sargons interview with "" the redpill "" director and she said the majority of rape and sexual assualt victims are men if you count prison rape . i know the cdc data gets us the non prison numbers , where are we getting the prison numbers from and do they include perpetrator ?
Ex3: orlando shooting and response . i find it interesting that when the nation was faced with a man raping a woman it was acceptable to blame men and say we need a system to teach men not to rape , but when someone of a specific faith commits an atrocity , the nation finds it unacceptable to blame that faith . i am not saying we should , in fact i am saying we should not demonize an entire group for an individual ' s actions so why do we ?
Ex4: in switzerland ' s law rape can only happen to women according to the [ criminalcode art .  number  ] (   it says : > rape > >  number  any person who forces a person of the female sex by threats or violence , psychological pressure or by being made incapable of resistance to submit to sexual intercourse is liable to a custodial sentence of from one to ten years .
Ex5: i think i just watched dc comics glorify harley quinn raping a man in a film ( spoilers ! ) watching the film "" batman and harley quinn "" , harley quinn ( dr . harleen quinzel ) drugs nightwing ( richard grayson ) with laughing venom and he wakes up tied to a bed . they are talking and after a nice shot of her ass , she looks down and it ' s somewhat implied he got a boner from that , and she makes sexual advances on him . while he does say "" i am not saying no .   that could be nice "" the context here is that he ' s tied up by a woman he knows has a history of violence who might seriously hurt him ( he is unable to defend himself ) if angered , so it seems to me like while he appears to give verbal consent ( nw "" the things i do for gotham .   "" + hq "" i will take that as a yes "" ) i think the argument could be made here that this is coerced consent given in a situation of duress . while this is not the first time nightwing has been raped ( mirage impersonated his girlfriend starfire , tarantula mounted him when he was exhausted / shocked , both in the comics ) this seems like the most eroticized of the three which does not play up the moral problems with what occurred .

Ex1: i finally got around to watching "" fantastic lies "" this was a great documentary ! i am glad that a mainstream documentary did talk about false accusations and the damages that it can have . i think the one thing that really hurt the guys on the team was jesse jackson and the black activists came out and defended the accuser . i think they escalated things quicker than they should . this movie reinforced a belief that the accused names should not be published when an accusation comes up .
Ex2: man arrested by mob after a women made an accusation of him filming up her skirt . most here would concentrate their anger on this woman making a false allegation . but should not we be even more worried about the insanity of these white knights ganging up on a guy just on the word of a woman on the remote chance a camera might have been in the proximity of her legs . an onlooker mentioned the arrested was lucky he wasn ' t beaten up . this demonstrates alot about how little men today value the welfare of men versus the welfare of women in what many regard as the most advanced country in the world in terms of development of civil rights .
Ex3: i am a female who was the accused in a title ix investigation . yes , title ix truly is unfair to men . * * tl / dr * * : i was involved with guy for  number  months . found out he was a two - timing cheater with a long - term girlfriend in another city . i confronted him and then told the girlfriend . he told the girlfriend and posted on facebook that i was a stalker who had called him hundreds of times , showed up at his house unannounced and contacted his family . he also claimed he was meeting with the school deal with is “ alleged stalker . ” he kept his word and made a false allegation against me . the school started a title ix investigation . the school immediately believed his story even before they spoke to me . the investigator wouldn ’ t let me tell my side of the story , and actually told me she wasn ’ t interested in hearing my story . she then proceeded to write only his side of his story and use certain words to make it seem like i had conceded to it . “ crystal admits she contacted his girlfriend . ” she was not there to be a neutral , impartial investigator , but was only calling to corroborate his story . she also refused to follow up on my list of witnesses . remember the investigator is also the judge and jury in these title ix proceedings . i hired a lawyer to help me . i ended up being able to tell my side of the story in the investigatory report . bobby ended up chickening out and dropped the case . it was a terrible experience , but seeing how the school immediately believed my accuser and tried to limit my ability to defend myself , made me see how title ix was truly designed to railroad the accuse ,  percent  of men being the accused . * *   edit   : * * thank you to everyone who gave encouraging responses to my story . but after much thought , i have decided to remove the long version of the post post . particularly , because of the level of negativity i have received in the last  number  hours . first , i was trolled by a pro - title ix female who falsely claimed my story was copy and pasted from another reddit story . ms . pro - title ix later stated the point of her claiming my story was copied was to show me what it is like to not have somebody not believe me , like women are not believed when they make allegations against men . my story is  percent  original , you can copy / paste in google , you won ’ t find anything . also , there are not many accused women in title ix proceedings . second , my motives were questioned and i was accused of “ wanting to post a story about myself for attention ” rather than truly advocating men ’ s issues . i was accused of being an undercover feminist "" making up a feminist fantasy story ” . ( yes   lol   ) i received hateful responses from individuals who called me a “ crazy cunt ” and told me i deserved to be falsely accused for outing my two - timing ex to his girlfriend . i received comments from other men on this sub , reprimanding me for advocating due process issues . apparently , they hate the idea of fair trials and due process for men . i never thought trying to advocate an issue would lead to so much drama and negativity . for some reason or another , i am either bullied or punished for sympathizing with men ’ s issues . it sucks when you truly want to advocate an issue for the thousands of men who go through title ix cases yearly . so i have decided to follow the advice of others and place the full text on another subreddit . i am still campaigning to make reforms in title ix . i hope to continue to share my story through meaningful outlets and hope it will serve as a catalyst for change in the system . thank you to those who shared positive words and i hope you can join the movement for due process too . feel free to dm me for questions , and convos regarding my story . krazyforlove
Ex4: there is a men ' s rights angle to the samantha bee ' feckless c "" story . what she said was “ do something about your dad ’ s immigration practices , you feckless c – t ! he listens to you ! put on something tight and low - cut and tell your father to f — ing stop it ! ” am i the only one to notice that she casually suggested that the president was sexually interested in his daughter ? all this stink , ' ohh dear , she called a woman the c word , how awful ' false accusations against men are so casually thrown around these days that no one even notices 
Ex5: peyton manning situation potentially setting damaging due process rights . i am sure many of you heard of this nonsense regarding peyton manning about a law suit from  number  years ago being brought up again today . my biggest worry is that the general public / media seems to be giving fuel to this feminist treatment of legal procedures regarding due process and compromise of integrity of justice . if you follow this story , you will notice the accuser ' s story has changed over the years . initially in  number  there was no mention of genitals touching , this wasn ' t brought up until  number  when she opened a defamation suit to get more money . she has also tried to unsuccessfully sue fashion designer for danna karan . there is this   dangerous   trend in society that specifically regarding accusers of sexual assualt they are given certain liberties , flexibility , and entitlements regarding compromise of testimony as well as also have to completely ignore every accuser ' s reputation or character . they are treating her story like it ' s a solid consistent story given at the very beginning of the whole ideal . this "" believethevictims "" garbage gives women the unfair advantage of assuming credibility for inconsistent stories that change over time and tellings . peyton ' s story has been consistent from day  number  , but naughright ' s accusations have become more egregious and embellished every time the story gained traction . it ' s sexist to portray women as fragile creatures incapable of the intellectual ability to form coherent and consistent memory . if anything this precedent could harm women , a woman could give a story and an argument could be made that the since she ' s a woman , the truthfulness of her story is shown to change over time , so we should not place that much credence to this testimony itself .
Ex6: why can not a guy also falsely accuse a woman ? i understand that in the media or socially a guy accusing a woman would not be taken as seriously . but legally , when it comes to the police they have to follow the same procedures . i know guys also report much less often , but the police have to do their jobs . she ' d be investigated and there ' d be consequences . but why do people only talk about women falsely accusing men ? edit : i do think too that false accusations from either men or women are really low . but in debates about this everyone says only women will falsely accuse , and it ' s just not true .

Ex1: canadian authorities in report on rehtaeh parsons suicide : "" there is an urgent need to adapt and react differently in the face of the rapid harm social media can cause . ""   pdf   link to the full independent report commissioned by justice department :   more info about rp suicide is here :   conclusions from the report : "" certain factors set this case apart from other cases involving sexual assault allegations that i think should have factored more prominently . "" "" it stands to reason that a person who is ill or in distress is unlikely to consent to sexual activity . "" "" rehtaeh did not consent to being photographed and , in fact , did not know a picture had been taken of her at the time . "" "" legislation has long ago been passed to eradicate the ' twin myths ' about a complainant ’ s credibility and the likelihood of consent based on her prior sexual history . as explained by the supreme court of canada : the main purpose of the legislation is to abolish the old common law rules which permitted evidence of the complainant ’ s sexual conduct which was of little probative value and calculated to mislead the jury . the common law permitted questioning on the prior sexual conduct of a complainant without proof of relevance to a specific issue in the trial . evidence that the complainant had relations with the accused and others was routinely presented ( and accepted by judges and juries ) as tending to make it more likely that the complainant had consented to the alleged assault and as undermining her credibility generally . these inferences were based not on facts , but on the myths that unchaste women were more likely to consent to intercourse and in any event , were less worthy of belief . these twin myths are now discredited . the fact that a woman has had intercourse on other occasions does not in itself increase the logical probability that she consented to intercourse with the accused . nor does it make her a liar . despite this legislation , these as well as other myths and stereotypes about sexual assault complainants still exist in our criminal justice system today . while great strides have been made over the years to eliminate the problem , there is no denying that the system is not perfect . underreporting , undercharging and low conviction rates continue to be a problem . discriminatory beliefs impact each of these steps . as observed by a former supreme court justice , the insidious nature of these beliefs make them difficult to eradicate : ' like most stereotypes , they operate as a way , however flawed , of understanding the world and , like most such constructs , operate at a level of consciousness that makes it difficult to root them out and confront them directly . ' we must nevertheless continue to fight against these stereotypes . the training that has been instituted by police in respect of how a person who has been subjected to trauma might respond to it , is a welcome contribution .

Ex1: hospital will not release records on child ' s circumcision - crossposted from r / legaladvice greetings , i live in ontario , and my son was circumcised without my knowledge or consent , the hospital refuses to provide me with records , who did it , why , etc . presumably because my son ' s mother falsified or lied on the paperwork , and my name is not mentioned on his records ( but is on his birth certificate ) , and we have joint custody because the courts have not ruled on custody yet so joint is the default position - a complaint was filed with the ministry of health , the ombudsman , the privacy commissioner , and my lawyer is drafting a motion for disclosure ; are there any other regulatory bodies i am missing in filing with edit : also tried filing with the college of physicians , but they told me without the doctor ' s name they can not investigate . also my son is now three , the procedure was done two years ago , the mother made repeated lies about who performed the procedure , where and why ; it wasn ' t until i spoke to her family doctor that he put in writing he recommended against it , that my ex cracked and i was able to find out . edit : mods in r / legaladvice triggered over   mgm   , deleted post .   citing it was going to stir debate on circumcision
Ex2: does intactivism ' s anti - semitism taint mr ? circumcision likely arose as an ancient hygienic practice , which became codified into religious tradition . modern hygiene renders the practice of little benefit , certainly insufficient to justify the health risks to the child . unfortunately , rather than simply arguing the medical facts ( which disfavour circumcision ) , a component of the intactivist community displays an unhealthy and somewhat shocking obsession with the jewish minority , who represent less than  percent  of circumcisions world - wide . when called out for their obsession , these intactivists rapidly degenerate into counting jews on committees , or ranting about "" jewish influence "" and "" jewish money , "" themes eerily and creepily similar to the rants of father coughlin , gerald lk smith , and julius streicher . ( the first two engaged in pro - nazi sedition in the   usa   ; the third was executed at nuremberg for crimes against humanity . ) apparently , i am not the first to discover the disturbingly anti - semitic component of intactivism : brendan o ' neill :   cavanaugh :   mcdermott :   > .   activists always seem to single out jews , .   the revival of grotesque caricatures of jews lusting for the blood of innocent babes , which have appeared in respectable newspapers and in campaigners ’ literature . baker   for those given to the disgusting practice of counting jewish names , i note that o ' neill , cavanaugh , mcdermott , and baker are not likely to be jewish . nor am i the only potential no - circ supporter to be turned off by intactivism ' s obvious problem of anti - semitism : "" anti - semitism turns off supporters of circumcision bans ""   as valid medical arguments do exist against circumcision , iintactivism ' s obsession with the jewish  percent  reflects badly upon mr as a whole , as do the ludicrous tropes of "" jewish influence , "" "" jewish control , "" jewish money , "" etc . the conservative william f . buckley rehabilitated american conservatism by relentlessly booting bigots from the movement . similarly , the leaders of mr ( elam , buchanan , etc ) would do well to distance themselves from intactivism ' s bigotry , even while emphasising and relying upon the solid medical arguments against circumcision .
Ex3: explaining to my circumcised son . my four year old son is circumcised and my  number  month old son is not . when i had the procedure done to my four year old i did not know much about it except that everyone i ' d ever known had it done . after watching him scream and bleed for days i finally researched it and realized what a horrible thing i had done . my biggest regret in life , hands down . along comes the new baby . i do not even consider circumcision and he is intact . now my four year old is starting to ask why his penis looks so different from his brother ' s . i do not want him to think there is anything wrong with his penis but i also want to give him an age appropriate and truthful answer . so , any suggestions on how to explain this to him now ? how about when he is older ? thanks so much ! you guys are the best .
Ex4:  male genital mutilation (   mgm   ) ( circumcision ) why are not we ( as a society ) concerned about forced circumcision of males ? most of know the horror stories surrounding female genital mutilation that occurs throughout many parts of africa , how about we acknowledge the male genital mutilation (   mgm   ) that takes place thousands of times every day in the western world . circumcision is an antiquated practice that serves no practical use in modern society . we should stop robbing men of the sensitivity that their penis deserves .

"" brewer earned a bachelor ’ s degree in chemistry from spelman , the historically black college in atlanta "" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - not only is she a graduate , but she now sits on the board of trustees at spelman and is a major donor . which begs the question : if diversity is so important to her , why does she continue to support a school that (  number  ) does not admit males , and (  number  ) is disproportionately african american ? spelman is  percent  black , and  percent  black / biracial . out of  number  students , one is white .   so i just do not understand how she can say diversity is so important to her when she serves on the board of a school where they take such pride in their utter lack of diversity . spelman ' s mission statement actually reads , "" spelman empowers the whole person to engage the many cultures of the world .   "" really ? how do they do that ? by making sure their students are only exposed to people who look just like them ? "" comment provided by mr joe of toledo at  
Ex2: new   mtv   show ad promotes lynching black men . black man gets lynched :   download the video so we can spread it around if they take it down . lynching does not have to involve a rope . definition of lynching :   > lynching is an extrajudicial punishment by an informal group . it is most often used to characterize informal public executions by a mob in order to punish an alleged transgressor , or to intimidate a group . this video depicts white women lynching a black man for being * accused   * of sexual assault without trial . where have we seen this before ?   > emmett louis till (  date  –  date  ) was an african - american teenager who was lynched in mississippi at the age of  number  after reportedly flirting with a white woman .
Ex3: one statistic pretty much ends the  hashtag  me too   movement - - with it ' s supporters . and that statistic is this : black men get accused of assault far far more often than white men . colleges are not required to report numbers split by race but we are talking about something like * * twenty times more likely to be accused if you are black * * . these numbers basically show either that : (  number  ) black men are ten or twenty times more rapey than white men - - an obviously racist conclusion or (  number  ) most of the accusations ( in colleges at least ) are false ( and that women who make up stories have a thing for accusing black men ) in other words there ' s an incredibly strong racism element to  hashtag  me too   just as there was when all this happened before in the 1 9 2 0 s and they used to lynch the accused , again mostly black men , instead of fire them or kick them out of college . my twenty times more likely figure is based on this article ' s numbers ( which are only based on one college but i think would likely hold across the board ) :

Ex1: political party in spain tries to abolish the injust law of gender violence . one of the most popular parties right now in spain , ciudadanos , is trying to abolish the law of gender violence , a law that subsituted the law of domestic violence in  number  . this law creates inequality in scenarios of domestic violence as it creates a greater punishment for men because it asumes he abused a position of power in the relationship . ciudadanos has in its electoral program to create a more equal law of domestic violence by which a crime will be punished in the same way wether the perpetrator is a man or a woman . yesterday they defended this proposal in a debate ( albeit the person defending it did not do a good job at it ) and as expected was treated harshly by all the other representatives (  number  more ) . one of them even argued that the law was fair becaused we lived "" in a system of patriarchy , in which there is an opression of the woman by the man . the elections in spain will be the 2 0 th of december and this political party has real possibilities of winning them after the  number  main parties in spain ( pp and   psoe   ) have declined .  
Ex2: have been asked to write an article on domestic violence against men for a high end family law firm . i feel this is a good opportunity for r / mensrights to produce a high quality , well substantiated article to highlight dv against men . the outline of the article will basically be  number  . men are victims of domestic violence  number  . the way we as a society react to dv against men  number  . because of societies attitudes towards men , men are not applying for non - molestations orders in the same number as women any advice , information , sources would be great . nb : the firm is english so uk sources preferable .
Ex3: looking for statistics on domestic violence i am looking for some statistics about domestic violence for a discussion with a feminist . i ` ve seen these studies before but it takes a lot of time to search them up so i thought maybe someone here has them handy . i am looking for metastudies that show women initiate most mutual violence . i am looking for metastudies of dating violence amongst younger people that show women are more often the perpetrators amongst young people .
Ex4: ' ' domestic violence ' ' as expected , woman lies about domestic violence . but but but why would poor victim woman tell lies ? son you know nothing ! [    time  of this video . this bitch says ' ' i am going to hit myself .   \ [ unaudible \ ] .   so you are going jail for domestic violence ! ' ' . this is why innocent untill proven guilty protects innocent men from angry feminists .
Ex5: idea : let us have an   ama   with a cop i have seen a few cops and retired cops post and comment on this subreddit , and it gave me an idea . why do not we have an   ama   with one of them ? we can ask them questions about things like how rape accusations are handled , domestic violence against men , etc . as for verification that they actually are a cop , r / askleo does that . i think that the cop gives the mods there his badge number and they check with police departments to make sure that he actually is a police officer . if they get verified , they get a special flair .

Ex1: how the traditional approach to domestic abuse is endangering children .   cafe   toronto . featuring karen woodall , a world authority on parental alienation and family reunification . the traditional model of domestic abuse is deeply flawed . scholarly research is clear that men and women are equally likely to be victims of domestic abuse . this serious dysfunction severely affects a child ’ s development and transmits intergenerational trauma . but once we recognize the problem , we can take steps to protect children and break the cycle of abuse . for more information and to register .

Ex2: domestic abuse of all the issues men have to face the lack of respect shown to this particular issue is easily the most infuriating . we can start with the duluth model and work our way out from there . the fact that this particular page is so short in an area that needs attention badly is almost tragic . especially since abuse can be done in more ways than just physical abuse . this blog by men ' s rights resources there are a bevy of written articles there that will not only hopefully give men a way to spot and know a little more about this . the article is written in three parts  number  ) articles , and research  number  ) how to spot abuse ( a very critical skill for your brothers to see )  number  ) resources for those in need   not only hopefully give men a way to spot and know a little more about this . the article is written in three parts  number  ) articles , and research  number  ) how to spot abuse ( a very critical skill for your brothers to see )  number  ) resources for those in need i would encourage you to go over this site and peruse the resources available there  
Ex2: another reason we should be concerned about women who commit dv and emotional abuse i registered this account specifically to post or / r / cptsd a while back . if you review my post history , you can learn about how i have been coming to terms with some of the baggage i carry from the way i was raised , and please be aware that i am well aware that others have it much worse than i do . i did once mention this sub on / r / cptsd and i got flamed for endorsing a "" hate group "" . whatever . i have been lurking here a while and i rarely post , but something just hit me when i watched the video linked here : [   you take a woman ( or a man ) who commits dv or emotional abuse to an intimate partner , and then how do you expect that they will treat their children ? i guarantee you that anyone who physically or emotionally abuses an intimate partner is going to abuse their children , as well . guarantee it ! if you want to know what that looks like , just take a few minutes to browse / r / raisedbynarcissists , / r /   justnomil   , / r / cptsd , / r / casualchildabuse , / r / insaneparents , and more . also , as an aside , there is an excellent post that breaks down different types of child abuse : [   i think that a lot of it applies to intimate partner abuse just the same .

Ex1:  toronto instagram page defames men with unverified rape and abuse allegations and instagram is okay with it . the page is [   . this page spreads unverified rumours about men but is a private page so that the people being accused can never see the posts . i have had my female friend report them to instagram for harassment and bullying but instagram got back to her saying that it did not violate any of their rules . &  hashtag  x 200 b   ; as men , any of us that still are in the cesspool of instagram should be reporting this page and putting pressure on instagram to remove this page .
Ex2:  hashtag  yes all men   but  hashtag  not all muslims   been hearing about the protests / counter - protests in germany all day on the radio . apparently it ' s the facist right - wing islamophobic movement spreading fear and hatred , while the leftist are showing their support for the refugees . how does this make any sense ?
Ex3: hashtag  male lives matter   look at this :   we hear a lot about how blacks are disproportionately killed by police ( especially when unarmed ) . however , if we look at the data , we also see that of the  number  unarmed people killed by cops this year ,  number  were men . that is  percent  . why do not we ever hear about this while we constantly hear about police violence against blacks ?
Ex4: terry crews ' involvement with the recent gillette ad i thought of this after i overheard some people in my school talking negatively about terry crews ' involvement in the in the gillette ad &  hashtag  x 200 b   ; all of this is , of course , my opinion and may be inaccurate but i have been a long time fan of terry so i felt obliged to try to see things from his perspective . &  hashtag  x 200 b   ; i think terry is right about most things in life , for example : love all people , if you work hard enough you can achieve a tremendous amount , even his views on pornography resonates with me but often his over - willingness to prescribe to an alt - left view , i think he does this because he cant see the hypocrisy and was raised by an abusive father , means that he does not see through the heaping hypocritical bullshit that comes out of the alt - left these days and just wants to be as kind as possible not realising ( in my opinion ) what he is doing is severely and negatively affecting men ' s ability to be themselves and develop in the right way . &  hashtag  x 200 b   ; i ' d love to hear what you guys think about this and whether anything of what i have said makes sense or sounds reasonable . i am just speaking from my knowledge which may not be as good as i thought , thanks  happy

Ex1: why are our young men killing themselves ? i continually hear about the suicide epidemic among men , yet have never really heard what the cause of it is . while we often do not truely know , ( which is a morbid thought ) i am curious as to what issues people believe to be the main causes of this problem , and why the issue is being continually ignored . you do not have to provide an answer here , per say ( as it is likely very complex ) but if you could point me to another place where a response has been articulated .
Ex2: why is it with the mass media when there ' s a name & face to a suicide .   it ' s always a female ? and the real mindfuck is that statistically men kill themselves at 4 x the rate . i realize we live in a society where females are almost always the victim and the media reinforces this .   but this double standard really irks me . and apparently we men are the ones that are privileged . unreal .

Ex4: australian documentary about male suicide turned into feminist propaganda ? i have been at the last world congress of science and factual producers and while meeting mostly interesting people , one encounter stood out in a bad way . a producer ( woman ) started talking about her last documentary about male suicide , made for australian tv . at first i thought great , somebody talks about men ! well , then i started asking her questions on the subject , causes , and solutions she offered in her program . guess what ' s the cause ? toxic masculinity , of course ! men hold unrealistic expectations of women ! the solution is clearly more feminism and educating men on how to be more "" men "" .   needless to say that meeting destroyed my mood for the night and i left . sadly , without recording her name or the show . more sadly , if i had enough arguments and studies in my head , i would have pushed the issue further as i am ok to confront people with uncomfortable topics . if anyone hear seen the documentary , please write the name in the comments . other than that , lots of feminism and identity politics vibe in the documentary - making world .

"
5,Work,"Ex1: interview discrimination or something ? okay i am still very freaked out from this . so i had a job interview on tuesday for a position as a manger at a clothing store . it went really well . the hiring manager was enthusiastic and liked my answers . she was interested in not only the answers i gave but the stories behind them . she all but offered me the job . she had to first have me interview with her boss . so yesterday i interviewed with the district manager . the dm was a younger female . before the interview even started i noticed a few red flags . first , she made sure to mention how she had been with the company for  number  years , starting out as a sales associate and was surprised i was so young for a management applicant . for reference , i am  number  . this put me on edge as if she did not believe i was qualified . second , she asked me about myself . i told her i was a business student going into my final year . i was a high performer at my previous role as a supervisor at a medium volume retail clothing store . she made quick to mention that this store was considered high volume ; meaning it had lots of sales happening and was a physically large store . in the most condescending tone she asked if i thought i could handle a big store as "" just a boy . "" third , we had the actual meat of the interview and it went okay . fourth , she asked if i had any questions . i asked her about pay . in my original interview i was asked by the store manager what my preferred pay should be . in that first interview i gave a figure that incorporated my experience and knowledge as well as what would be a fair figure after i finished college . i made sure to mention i would be done in the spring and have my degree then . the sm said it was fine to incorporate that near future data . anywat , the dm was not having that . i gave the same number and she said it was "" a little high "" for soemone like me . i asked what she meant by that . she flat out said "" a man who thinks he ' s qualified just because he will have a degree . "" at this point i do not even want the job anymore . i would not want to deal with this  number  something white feminist kook . so i turned the interview into a farce . she had one final question . dm : why should i remember you ? me : am i the only male candidate ? dm : honestly , yes . me : i should not be hard to remember then . i smiled and then we exchanged handshakes and i left and then reentered so i looked around the store and overheard this next bit . the dm pulled the sm to the side on the next aisle over . dm : i did not like him . sm : why ? dm : i do not have to tell you why . sm : well i am calling him later to offer him the job . dm : i am going to fire you if you give him the job . i left . i went home . i waited for a call . so i actually would like this job . it ' s pretty cool . part of me wants to call the store manager and see what she says . the other part wants to get a lawyer for discriminatory hiring practices . tl ; dr district manager was a sexist bitch and threatened the store manager to jot give me the job .
Ex2: first time accused well like many stories i have read , mine starts the same way .   walked into a meeting and given a letter that tells me two female employees have accused me of sending inappropriate text messages . i was only somewhat shocked and probably more angry . some backstory : i recently came out as an alcoholic and have been seeking treatment for the last six months and maintaining my sobriety . well on friday i had a slip after a very tough week at work . i reached out to another coworker and somehow the conversation was considered to be inappropriate .   there was no mention of anything sexual , she at no time told me to stop the conversation and i still have all the texts . now the second conversation i have no memory of and there ' s nothing in my phone indicating there was a conversation . i have been out off work for two days paid and then have a meeting at nine am friday to tell my side . i am in canada ( ontario ) and i am scared . i would never do these things sober and i do not remember the second one at all so i can not defend any actions . will i be fired , told to take a course ? i am scared . anyone been through this before or know the law ? should i get a lawyer ?
Ex3: i work at a company and i think i might be getting scolded because i am male . i began working here about  number  weeks ago . since then i have done my best to be friendly to everyone and treat everyone with respect . i am working in apparel and am the only male employee in this division . i have recently been subject to nonstop ridicule by my managers about things that contradict another thing that was said . it ' s humiliating and the way they go about it is rude . for example : i am expected to put away clothes from a rack . however , i was told i went to the rack far too much . then , i was told that i do not put away enough clothes . i have been told i talk to much to coworkers while my female coworkers never get scolded for doing the same thing . i try and go above and beyond and keep working towards a single goal . i just feel so belittled . i am almost made to feel bad about myself . any advice ?
Ex4: "" no shorts "" dress codes for men - - current thoughts ? women can wear skirts and sandals at my workplace \ - \ - men are forbidden to wear shorts or open \ - toed shoes . i work in a very casual office where no one bats an eye at sneakers , t \ - shirts , sweatshirts . a woman on my team wears yoga pants every day as well . still my company is under the delusion that we are "" business casual "" and that men wearing shorts or sandals violates this . i most likely will not be bringing this up at work for fear of the backlash negatively influencing my future at the company . let swamp \ - ass season begin . what are this sub ' s thoughts on the matter ?
Ex5: "" let go "" from work due to false accusations from a female intern i am new to this sub , but i am hoping that i can get some real advice on what to do next . i was let go from work today because a  number  y / o female intern reported me for "" inappropriate conduct "" . the legal department contacted me , told me what her chief complaint was , and it was total garbage . i sent legal emails , proving that she was lying . my division manager was interviewed and she told legal that this was retribution . she was caught plagiarizing my work once , i reported it , and she was warned . she did it a second time and i reported it again . these interns have rotations where at the end of their rotations , they are reviewed , and if they are not performing satisfactorily , they are let go from the program . my manager is her manager . she told me that she was missing her progress meetings , regularly . i said of course she was , i cut her off from any of my work data and she has nothing . at the end of her rotation , i am accused of "" inappropriate conduct "" , and now , she can not get fired because that would be considered retaliation against her . my division manager told legal this and it did not matter one bit . there ' s a lot more to it , but the gist of the matter is , a female intern reports me to legal for inappropriate conduct , with just spoken words , and i get fired because of it . i gave legal emails that proved that she was lying .   it did not matter . she worked  number  miles away from me at a remote site and she claims that i was inappropriate towards her . i never even saw her in person ! i am very upset about this right now and i want to take a few days to calm down before i act . there ' s some other legal bs on my side that is very wrong too , but i do not want to go into that , as that ' s not the original reason why i got terminated . can anyone offer any resources / help ? thank you in advance for any positive feedback .

Ex1: feminism in relationships / a hard breakup story .   i have been a long time lurker on this sub and i have taken a lot of good things from this sub . but let us get into it .   i have been in a relationship for about a year now and it steadily started to decline about a  number  months ago . we stopped going on dates , she started working more hours , becoming more and more unavailable during our planned days off and just simply not interested anymore . well last night it all came out . after a post christmas rock and roll christmas concert she told me she wanted to break up because i am not on board with her and her opinions on feminism .   just that   . nothing else . now do not get me wrong . i do believe in equality between males and females . i believe in compromise . i tried to explain why i am not into feminism like she is and of course she kept saying that because i believe in equality i am a feminist . that ' s where i started to prove her wrong and quoting a few rad fems and explaining also why the reason i am not a feminist is much like i am an atheist . because there are some bad apples in every bunch and i ' d rather stand on my own rather than side by side with those bad apples . she did not get it we are still broken up .   so here i am .   drunk at work trying to roll a few good looking omelets and writing this .   can someone help me try to work this out ? or help me say something to her that ' ll break this tension of opinions ?
Ex2: feminization of workplace culture , oppression of men stats and strategies please ? i am really tired of the feminization of culture in general and the prevalence of sexual rhetoric in the workplace . i am a man that wants a normal life , to work with people who are good at what they do and live my life the way i see fit . why is it okay to shame , degrade , denigrate men these days ? looking for advice , statistics , facts from the community that could help ?
Ex3: feminism and its purpose ? i have been thinking about the women and few guys who make up the current 3 rd wave of feminists . why are they against men ? maybe it has something to do with their upbringing , maybe they got rejected by a guy ( "" nice guy situation "" ) or maybe they are ostracized ? i do not see the need of feminism today as it already served its purpose of giving women rights . so what are the current feminists trying to achieve ?
Ex4: dear feminists , the anti - abortion movement is mostly made up of women . it ' s not so much men telling you what to do with your bodies , but other women . go to any pro - life event and you will see mostly women there with their babies . just thought i ' d like to make that clear as i see shit like this on / r / feminism :

------------------------------

Ex1: wage gap ! ok , i know the wage gap controversy proposing that men make on average a certain amount more than women do has been debunked . that it has been chalked up to difference in experience or other factors . but anytime the argument arises there is always a female or two set on the idea that it still exists . well , i am on mobile so i will not be posting sources or anything . everything i say can be looked up by googling though . i was under the impression that everyone of equal rank in the military made the same amount . if their situations were similar . married , single , hazard pay .   to my surprise , i found that women actually make more than men in the military due to an allowance issued to everyone for maintaining their uniforms . this allowance is called   cma   or clothing maintenance allowance . myself and all other males receive roughly  number  bucks a month for it , while all females receive roughly  number  bucks a month . making equally qualified and ranked females earn roughly  number  more dollars in a  number  year career . now i am not upset about earning  number  less , i am upset that even while they make more , they still get behind the concept of a wage gap in our favor . the times have changed . women have all the same rights as men , and now some that men do not have . yet i still get treated like a make in the 6 0 s did . when is someone going to stand up and say that women are treated better ? when will it be okay for me to feel oppressed ? i already have a documented smaller chance of acceptance into the officer corpse for being a white male than a female , and a much lower chance than say a female of minority . but all these things hide behind fancy names like affirmative action and needed for diversity . when wil the best possible job applicant get the job based on qualification over race or gender ? end rant . sorry if this is not the correct forum or format for this type of thing , i just feel like this is the only place i can say this without being persecuted as someone who hates women . which i do not . i just wish they would stop hating me for unfounded reasons .
Ex2:   stem   disparity caused by economic factors , not socialization . [ post  number  months ago about norwegian gender paradox ] (   apparently according to the same institute that got its funding cut after harald ela finished his documentary "" brainwash "" , the   stem   gap is caused by economic factors . women have been getting into   stem   , but men have not been going into pink collar occupations . women also avoid   stem   because they want to spend more time on their families . this is because   stem   , unlike pink collar jobs , tends to be much less flexible . explains why women leave   stem   as well . whether this is because of socialization is unknown . quite the about face . [ here ' s the link ] (  
Ex3: my anti - man family so i am just venting here , but let me just say that regardless of political affiliation i still love my family to death , not to say they are not blind sometimes . so me and my aunt got pretty into it on snapchat about women ' s issues and stupid shit like that . she directed me to all these buzzfeed articles ( "" it ' s unbiased news , honey "" ) that obviously supported her side and made ridiculously false claims . i wanted to seriously school her , like i would on anyone else who says white boys are a problem , you know ? i did not just because i do not want family gatherings to be awkward . she also brought up how apparently taking birth control is oppression , even though men have to wear an uncomfortable condom for the entire time . she makes all these laughable arguments like the wage gap and how women apparently have to be on the watch for rapists  number  /  number  . dude , you do not know how fuckin bad i wanted to go off , "" well , bitch , the wage gap does not take into account .   "" you know ? she sure did not know what to say about our sexual assault argument . i obviously said that it is a serious issue , but it is not a pandemic for women like she is making it sound . the ironic thing here is that i , a teenage boy , have been a victim of sexual assault , and she has not . i was molested when i was a young boy ( still not a feminist , and rooted for kavanaugh ) . there ' s another thing though . she always brings out the age card . all the "" oh honey , you are too young to know what you are talking about . "" yeah , she said that . well , joke ' s on her because i am  number  years younger than her and know far more about politics than she could ever dream of knowing . damn , men need some recognition for shit like this like now .

Ex2: bill maher : i think the country is anti - men i just came across a really interesting interview bill maher did with larry king in  number  . bill maher : "" somewhere along the line it became national law that women are spiritual , ethereal , perfect beings , and men are brutish louts . and i feel sorry for the lummox who comes home at six o ' clock and has not been watching oprah all day and does not understand about what he ' s supposed to be , and what men are supposed to be , because he was at work all day . larry king : you think they are anti - men ? bill maher : i think the country is . i mean look at all of our culture . it ' s always head up his ass dad and brilliant mom , who treats the husband like one of the children . and somehow she ' s martyred and put - upon , but she gets through the day even with old dummy on her . video starts at  number   time  :  Ex3: youtube should make a national men ' s day on youtube spotlight . youtube spotlight had promoted  number  women ' s equality day videos and  number  international women ' s day videos and made  number  videos about women ' s equality . youtube spotlight also made  number  videos about transgenders pride and promoted another  number  . youtube spotlight uk promoted another  number  international women ' s day video . as a result , these videos get loads of exposure and views . i could not find a single video that youtube spotlight uploaded or promoted that is about celebrating men ' s day .
Ex4: buzzfeed celeb thirst tweets videos are sexist . not sure if this has been mentioned here before but i haven ’ t seen it . i got a recommendation for a buzzfeed celeb video of shawn mendes reading “ thirst tweets ” . in the first few seconds it was instantly noticeable that there were a lot of women saying very sexual things towards him along the lines of having his kids , commenting on his body / muscles , saying he can choke them . so i had a look for any other thirst tweet videos by buzzfeed celeb . even found a playlist . of all of the videos out of the many i could find  number  had a woman in it . the other  number  -  number  videos were all with male celebrities . and the one with the woman in it the tweets were either sweet or lewd from other women . thing is if any of the tweets from the other videos had been said to her it ’ d be sexist and be called toxic masculinity . “ i ’ d love to touch her back muscles ” would be “ creepy ” and yet buzzfeed have multiple videos of women saying this to men . now obviously this is no big news buzzfeed is sexist , stupid and nothing good ever comes from them , but the shawn mendes video has 1 8 0 k likes to 1 k dislikes . it ’ s just stupid .

Ex1: divorce is worse than rape at least with rape there ' s closure . alimony and child support are fo -   evah   you lose half ( or more ) of everything you own . then you have to watch as another man hangs out with your kids , drives around in what was your car , live in your old house and fucks your ex wife . then you drive home in your used corolla to a one bedroom apartment in a bad part of town to sleep on a crappy mattress on the floor completely alone fearing how you are going to pay for their lives and have nightmares of what they are doing while you suffer . this is not always the case but it is very common ( and is the actual story of my now suicidal uncle ) .
Ex2: divorce not final , wife pregnant by another man my wife and i have a signed and notarized separation agreement that lays out the grounds for our separation . one of which is her being on my company health insurance plan . she informed me yesterday that she is pregnant with her boyfriends baby and he has forced her to stop working , he does not know she has her insurance through me and that she will not be able to pay the weekly premium that is deducted from my paycheck . also , according to the insurance provider i would be responsible for any unpaid bills relating to the pregnancy and i cannot remover her from the policy . also , in north carolina , even though we have been separated since december , because our divorce is not final , it is presumed by law that the child is mine . i have an attorney doing some research but i want opinions please !   update   ! spoke with the attorney and did some research , i am able to drop her from the insurance , and i will have to have a   dna   test done as well as a signed affidavit stating that he is the father and then i am off the hook !
Ex3: mens role in marriages i was raised to be told that in marriages , we are equal , if there are problems , we should seek counselling and compromise . yet i feel like society is always siding with the woman and not listening to the men opinions . directly demonizing the man the instant they have an opinion on anything that goes against the women within the marriage . once my wife says "" im tired "" , all my opinions are thrown out of the window and everyone advice becomes biased towards the tired one . no one cares if men are tired because we are strong beings . i despise any man with power that would hurt a women . yet somehow i feel like now is a bad time to be born a man . when i seek advice on my marriage this is how i feel . if i am wrong , so be it , but do not need to talk to me as if i am a demon for having an opinion . anyone else feels this way ?
Ex4: michael combes interview with marine vet and divorced father scott momper - on male disposability , divorce and child custody . michael combes is a documentarian who is currently working on a film called "" cash and prizes .

6,Family,"Ex1: taylor & johnson debunk rape hysteria again taylor & johnson consistently fight for men ' s rights in matters of ( false ) campus rape accusations . just recently :   & nbsp ; earlier :           & nbsp ; while mr cannot be strongly partisan , i note that liberal media ( such as   nyt   and wapo and huffpo ) consistently advance the hysteria , while conservative media consistently publish articles ( as taylor & johnson ' s ) debunking the hysteria .
Ex2: looking statistics on prison rape . i was listening to sargons interview with "" the redpill "" director and she said the majority of rape and sexual assualt victims are men if you count prison rape . i know the cdc data gets us the non prison numbers , where are we getting the prison numbers from and do they include perpetrator ?
Ex3: orlando shooting and response . i find it interesting that when the nation was faced with a man raping a woman it was acceptable to blame men and say we need a system to teach men not to rape , but when someone of a specific faith commits an atrocity , the nation finds it unacceptable to blame that faith . i am not saying we should , in fact i am saying we should not demonize an entire group for an individual ' s actions so why do we ?
Ex4: in switzerland ' s law rape can only happen to women according to the [ criminalcode art .  number  ] (   it says : > rape > >  number  any person who forces a person of the female sex by threats or violence , psychological pressure or by being made incapable of resistance to submit to sexual intercourse is liable to a custodial sentence of from one to ten years .
Ex5: i think i just watched dc comics glorify harley quinn raping a man in a film ( spoilers ! ) watching the film "" batman and harley quinn "" , harley quinn ( dr . harleen quinzel ) drugs nightwing ( richard grayson ) with laughing venom and he wakes up tied to a bed . they are talking and after a nice shot of her ass , she looks down and it ' s somewhat implied he got a boner from that , and she makes sexual advances on him . while he does say "" i am not saying no .   that could be nice "" the context here is that he ' s tied up by a woman he knows has a history of violence who might seriously hurt him ( he is unable to defend himself ) if angered , so it seems to me like while he appears to give verbal consent ( nw "" the things i do for gotham .   "" + hq "" i will take that as a yes "" ) i think the argument could be made here that this is coerced consent given in a situation of duress . while this is not the first time nightwing has been raped ( mirage impersonated his girlfriend starfire , tarantula mounted him when he was exhausted / shocked , both in the comics ) this seems like the most eroticized of the three which does not play up the moral problems with what occurred .

Ex1: man guilty of killing unborn baby by kicking mum ' s stomach   excerpts : > their actions were described as "" incomprehensibly evil "" by malcolm mchaffie of the crown prosecution service . > > miss bantala , who was  number  weeks pregnant , had been buying decorations for her baby shower before the attack . > jurors had heard how miss bantala had been in an on - off relationship with wilson and had turned to him for comfort after the death of a nephew from sickle - cell anaemia . > > she decided to keep the baby , despite wilson ' s repeated attempts to persuade her to have an abortion because he was not ready for fatherhood . a lot of disturbing and thought - provoking things about this . the assault of course . the "" incomprehensibly evil "" remark makes me wonder at what week of pregnancy does killing the unborn cross to this from ' morally acceptable ' . and of course that this happened off the back of the guy not being able to legally opt out ( which is not excusing the assault ) . not all / much of this is a direct men ' s rights issue , and the abortion thing has been done again and again though not in this direct context .   but there ' s a lot of connected stuff going on here . thoughts ?
Ex2: just got banned from / r / relationships for saying a man deserves to know about his child before the woman straight up aborted it . my question is : why do women get to cop out with an abortion if "" they are not ready "" or they just do not want it even if the man does . but if the man does not want it and the woman does - hello child support for the next  number  years ! what a load of bullshit . imgur links :         my favorite part of all of this :  
Ex3: help : trying to find quote from woman about women being solely responsible for child support . i remember seeing an image on here with a quote a few months back basically staying something along the lines of , "" if a woman has the sole choice in bearing a child , then she should be solely responsible for caring for that child . "" i forget the woman who said the quote , but if anyone knows , can you point me to the image or quote and author of it ?
Ex4: my child is nearing  number  , now she decides to take me to court for child support . try to make it quick , been in my kid ' s life since day one and have my child at least two days a week . if not more . me and the mother have been on again / off again for years . it ' s a rollercoaster but i have helped with cash and other things they need at her apartment . i have even lived there at times . fast forward to present and i have been issued papers that she seeks  percent  of my income for child support . she filed papers two weeks after i got a promotion to the best paying job of my life   and   during a time span she was visiting my bedroom occasionally . i put an end to that part , it wasn ' t productive .   and i believe this was the spark igniting her rage . i feel completely unprepared . if my math is right , this will cripple me at  percent  plus i fear she will claim i did nothing for her over the years . so who knows what they will claim i owe her . i am lazy , in unorganized . i do not save text messages or pay her in money orders . i tried to keep it reasonable . but i am an active father and i will be in my child ' s life as much as she will let me . do i have any chance here ? i have let her use the dependent claim on taxes every single year . in an email to her i stated i should be able to claim him at least every other year . she refuses . getting a lawyer is really not something i want to do because i know i am going to have to pay her . this was just such a dirty , greed inspired tactic that i am floored .
Ex5: would any of you have a response to my eli5 : how is it in the child ' s best interest , for child support to be so largely driven by the split in custodial time ? ( xposted from eli5 ) [ in my ( too long ) eli5 ] (   i describe how my ex - wife took my custodial time so the split would no longer be  number  /  number  , and thereby secured  money  / week in child support , while the corresponding increase in her expense was only  money  / week ( based on   usda   estimates ) . i do not understand why it is the best interest of the child , for the division of custodial time to effect the split in child support in great excess of the actual additional expenses . if you have some insight , i will be grateful !
Ex6: should not men also get reproductive rights ? hey guys so before i start i apologize if this beating a dead horse as maybe this is something that ' s been covered on this subreddit . so as you all know , women have the right to an abortion . not only that but they also can abort regardless of the father ' s wishes or even without his knowledge . but here ' s the thing : a man has to pay child support if the woman decides to carry the baby to term , give birth and keep it . the man has no control over whether or not she keeps the baby . and while those feminists love to scream about consent , apparently a man ' s consent is not valid . he can not opt out of  number  years of work for child support ( compare that to a  number  month pregnancy . ) and in some cases such as this :   the man has to pay child support if he donates sperm and the woman finds some kind of loop hole . just to be clear i am pro - life and only find abortion just if the mother ' s life is in danger , but i do not want it to be illegal because that ' s a whole new set of problems . but the point is if one if going to hold to the notion of gender equality , why not be consistent and extend that to men ? many will tell a guy to ' ' man up ' ' or that he should have ' ' kept it in his pants ' ' . yet tell a woman she should have kept her legs closed and the world loses their damn minds . in conclusion , while i am not for abortion or deadbeat dads personally , from a purely legal standpoint it ' s only fair that if a woman is not obligated to parenthood neither should men . she owns her body , i should own my money .

Ex1: white knights do not believe that men should be able to speak for themselves . after spending a brief moment on againstmensrights ( i kind of like to see if any of my comments warrant a mention ) , i can see why links to the sub are barred here . those guys are idiots ( and the women too ) . anyway , i did find something that might be interesting to look at .   at first i thought maube they have a point even though i do not see a reason that men should not be ankle to speak for themselves . so i looked at the article .   t seems they wrote it because they got some negative feedback on their original post . "" many commenters responded , "" men are told things , too ! "" to which we ' d say : of course ! sexism does not exist in a vacuum . "" because you know it ' s   men   who are sexist . oh , and in case you forget they want to remind you that it is not the same thing . "" because women are the seen as weaker sex ; to be "" feminine "" is to be less than . so when we tell men they are not "" real men "" unless they are tough , financially successful ( specifically more successful than their female partners ) , strong , authoritative .   yes , we are hurting men who do not fit those parameters . but we are also hurting women . "" because none of the men who committed suicide are traditionally masculine . because people feel women are weak and need assistance all those women ' s shelters are really hurting women . do not forget it ' s only gender non - coonforming men who need shelters . the traditionally masculine guy never gets hurt even if he lost his job in an economic downturn . because all those women who do not die battling wild fires , in energy exploration , etc . are really being oppressed driving the car the men died to fuel or spending her husband survivor benefits / life insurance . men have never been told that ' s not lady like . sounds to me like that ' s devaluing the masculine , but the cry bullies would probably have a fit .
Ex2: i do not know if this question was asked or even answered but why are the media , the left and feminism so afraid of masculinity ? what is wrong with masculinity that everyone seems to demonize it ? like every problem in the world is always linked to masculinity ( in men of course , because when women are masculine they are empowered ) where in the world does this "" mas - scare "" come from ?
Ex3: non - toxic masculinity ? with all the chatter about "" toxic masculinity "" , i am curious . what would non - toxic masculinity look like ? do we need to re - define male and female sex roles ? if so , is there a factual scientific basis that we could use as a guide ? ( it ' s always a good idea to start with the facts ) q1 : are there any mostly masculine qualities that add value to today ' s society ? q2 : are there any mostly feminine qualities that add value to today ' s society ? put another way : are there any biological differences between the sexes that cause some beneficial attributes to be more common in one sex or the other ?
Ex4: is "" incel "" being used as an insult just a pc way to call someone a virgin ? so lately , i have noticed that the label "" incel "" has caught on . with all of the spite people can muster , the second you say something they do not like , you are an incel . it reminds me a lot of how until just a few years ago , you would be called a virgin online regularly . but over time , it became regarded as toxic to judge a man based on his sexual experience . is not incel just the same thing packaged differently ?
Ex5: gillette doubles down on hating all men - removes all downvotes . boycott > downvote go check out the toxic feminazi created ad -       your downvote may be missing . make sure you support alternatives to gillette - dollar shave club for disposable razors feather for safety razors . ( harrys razors seems to have the same anti male strategy . )

Ex1: fathers , how sick and tired are you of your contributions to the family unit being completely shrugged off ? i am sort of sick of seeing this shit considering my dad worked his   ass   off to make sure me and my family had a comfortable life . not to say my mom did not work her ass off either , but both my parents contributed greatly to my childhood , and yet it ' s my mom who only gets the credit . are you fathers out there sort of sick of this ?
Ex2: state of america ' s fathers - inaugural report men - care . org has just released a  number  page report on the state of fatherhood in the us . last year they did one on fathers worldwide . the web site has a bunch of infographics , and this link to download the full report :   men - care . org advocate around the world for paternity leave and against gender stereotyping .
Ex3: men , when have you felt most powerless because you are male ? not my best example but i was in   usa   and a group of us were discussing mothers day . i was saying that not necessarily all mothers are great and worthy of much celebration and that , without good parenting , being a mother can simply be because of biology . a girl across the table from me who i did not know and had said nothing then threw her beer at me . with one hand on my beer and my other arm in a sling i could not defend myself .
Ex4: father ' s rights advocate yesterday at my family court hearing , my soon to be ex wife had a women ' s shelter advocate as part representation , in addition to attorney . the advocate did not say anything other than her name to the court . .   this got me thinking .   is there such thing as a father ' s rights advocate ? or , how do i go about becoming one ? i am in minnesota . this whole process is slanted against men , let alone great dads that want to be there for their kids .

------------------------------

Ex1: is there a gender divide between men and women in the west ? i currently live in a country in asia . our men and women are very traditionally minded . us men doing men thing and women , while there are many of them in   stem   fields and pretty independent , their goal is still getting married and having children . feminism is pretty much non - existing even if i have to admit our society gives in a bit towards women , but i am not complaining since they actually appreciate it instead of screaming bloody hellhound but on your side , i see nothing but circus acts everywhere . the women , especially feminists wanting to ban anything that exists . everything is racist , everything is sexist , everything is homophobic . movies , games , tv shows , bathroom , air conditioner , nanotechnology , pencil , diamond , condom , .   just literally everything can be made into a problem if the feminists tweet hard enough . on the men side , we have   mgtow   , red pill and some sexist , not all , mras . the crazies on each side are driving the rational ones away from each other . now the women are complaining there are no good men left while the men just keep going from girl to girl and playing video games . might as well keep the two sides separated so no problem will arise . this is not how i imagine the first world west supposed to be if this post is a bit offensive or childish , i apologize . i just need a bit of room to vent
Ex2: thank you great women and men who spoke up for male victims . on international women ' s day i would like to thank great women and men who publicly stood up for male victims of discrimination and abuse ! i am grateful to karen straughan for her great videos , to cassie jaye for "" the red pill "" film , to deepika bhardwaj for "" martyrs of marriage "" film , to christina marie hoff sommers for bringing the issues men face to a very wide audience , to janet bloomfield , hannah wallen , alison trump ladin ( typhonblue ) for raising awareness of the issues . i am also grateful to sargon of akkad and paul elam for bringing public awareness to the issues men face . in fact , millions of men and hundreds of thousands of women in   usa   are aware of the oppression men face but most are afraid to speak up in wide forums . in fact without exaggeration , over  percent  of us are afraid to speak to a wide audience due to gender feminist bullying . like  percent  of people i have no wide audience .
Ex3: i am in love with a feminist , and we are going to watch the red pill at some point . i have never seen it . i need guidance . rag on me all you want , folks , but i love her . she does try to differentiate herself from "" feminazis "" , she herself even uses the word . she ' s supportive of men ' s reproductive rights , draft equality in a shaky way , domestic violence shelter equality , sex abuse treatment equality , and a good number of other things . we have had some more heated discussion about things and she is generally supportive with men ' s struggles but in disbelief that modern feminism is completely antagonistic in them . the only thing that really waves a huge red flag to me about serious indoctrination is that she believes in the wage gap . i try not to get into it with her , but that ' s not what i aim to talk about . i love this woman , she ' s said she will watch the documentary with me but i am worried . what are the contents like ? she ' s not very averse to controversy but i am just hoping it ' s not focused on finger - wagging at women like literally everything feminism spawns . sure , it ' s no big deal if it makes mention of female privilege and whatnot , but i just do not want her to feel like she ' s being dragged through the mud and i am supposed to get some kind of weird smug hard - on or something .
Ex4: in red pill swallowing , did femtheist devine swallow the red pill or is this the world ' s biggest   cya   ? does anyone know if this is this the same person ? for those unfamiliar with the femthiest devine , she advocated reducing men to  percent  of the population , imposing a national castration day , and reducing men to "" breeding stock "" essentially sex slaves to women . some of her youtube stuff might still be out there . i was looking for her original web site , but do not see it ( it might be archived somewhere if you want to look ) , but here is a link to the forgetten history of misandry entry for her .   it was even reported that she faked her death .   there was talk at one point of her having issues finding a job because of the stuff she put out there so maybe it ' s a way of reinventing herself . i am not convinced that she ' s a friend of the   mrm   , but i do see a bit of pro - men things on her new site and people change .   can anyone make heads or tails of this ?

------------------------------

Ex1: my ex - wife is moving to the country and brainwashing my children do not want to give too many details but , my ex - wife has completely disregarded a court order , taken the kids around 2 0 0 km away from me , and has reduced my visitation to the bare minimum . when my kids come around they are clearly brainwashed . they have told my family that they do not love me because i have hurt their mum and have taken all her money away . which is not true at all . they say lies that are obviously repeated from what they are mum has told them about me . false accusations . lies . it ' s disgusting . i know i am a great father and want my kids to be happy , how can i stop the brainwashing ? the courts wont do anything . there ' s nothing they can do even though she ' s broken the court order . even if we go through court again , the kids have changed their stance after the lies she has told them , so it will not be smart to go to court . if i took my kids and left , surely that would be seen as kidnapping but if she does it , since she ' s a woman , it ' s not . i do not understand . what can i do ? * sorry this is all over the place . * edited spelling
Ex2: my wife emotionally abuses me .   need advice ! i am married to my wife for  number  years . she has been emotionally abusive . in early years she would not talk to me for days over littlest of things ( silent treatment ) . then slowly i got to see a side of her where she would not let go if things did not go her way . she was cruel to me even though i all did was cared about her . when she saw me happy she would intentionally do things to hurt me . like in my happiest moment she would tell me things like "" we are not happy together . we should just live separately "" . hoping for things to magically go away and not ending my marriage at that point we had our first kid . at that point things started getting worse . we would have arguments and she would scream and yell in front of our  number  year old . that would leave me scared and frozen . still hopeful i thought someday my problems would magically go away and things would get better . then she said she wanted a second kid . i did not want a second kid because i saw the effect on first kid and there was no way i was ready for second kid . she started pushing for it more and more using devious tactics . after every attempt from her failed she threatened to divorce me and told me that it would make the first kid ' s life miserable . i suppose i could have divorced at that point but not being ready to see my kid ' s and my life fall apart i gave in and we had our second kid . did things improve after that ? not really . she got louder and louder in letting me know that she was in control . the worst part in this and to my utter disbelief was the fact that she had started using kids as leverage against me . yes , someone like me who grew in a world thinking that mom ' s love for kids is infinite i was lost living every day of my life where she had a clear message for me that either things go her way or kids suffer . she knows how successful she can be if she uses kids as tools to get what she wants from me . she never wants to spend time with kids and when i am busy , kids just keep watching tv and she does not give a shit . a year ago i made the brave decision to tell her to end our marriage . after i told her she became more aggressive and dangerous . instead of agreeing or thinking of everyone ' s best interest she chose to be a complete bully . she said she would take every penny she could squeeze out of me and that kids will stay with her primarily while coparenting . it is impossible to talk with her without her getting extremely loud and she is so manipulative i can not tell my situation to anyone in the family . she knows very well how to turn a discussion into he said , she said game and if not anything she will just lie . i need help . where should i go ? i see that there are a lot of resources for women who face abuse but where do i go as a man ? when i told my own parents that my wife has been abusive they started looking the other way . they know that i am in a bad situation but they think that i should stay in marriage for the sake of kids . they do not understand that it ' s not good or safe for kids in this marriage . i feel so lost . it ' s like a male claiming that he got raped by a female . who will believe him ? what next step should i take ? i know that divorce is the next step but knowing how dangerous she can be how can i minimize the damage to me and my kids . ps : this was a very short description of my situation but i would like to add that she does not like when i make friends . she tightly controls who i talk with and who i do not .
Ex3: a bit of a positive shared custody story . i want to start by saying these are not my kids , or any relation . my female neighbour has  number  kids to a few different fathers . the father of two of the children is living with them and i have befriended him ( and her ) since i moved to the place earlier this year . they have got a bit of a bad rap with the neighbours , but they have done nothing to me , so i have no problem being their friend . anyway , last night i was over seeing the bloke and was chatting to his girlfriend . she was saying that two of her sons ( who have the same father ) will be going to his house tonight until tomorrow night . you could tell she ' d rather have the kids herself ( which parent would not ? ) , but that they alternate it each year . she never complained or said anything bad about him , and thinking over it , she ' s never said anything negative about him in the past and its not uncommon for the kids to be at their dad ' s . i just thought i ' d share a bit of a positive story with what i think is a good , healthy form of shared custody and break up the negative stories a little bit . merry christmas everyone , i hope you have a good day . edit : when i also said to her that it ' s good they have got an arrangement that works for them , she agreed and said that it keeps it fair all the time . so even when mentioned , there wasn ' t a negative part of the interaction .

Ex1: canadian authorities in report on rehtaeh parsons suicide : "" there is an urgent need to adapt and react differently in the face of the rapid harm social media can cause . ""   pdf   link to the full independent report commissioned by justice department :   more info about rp suicide is here :   conclusions from the report : "" certain factors set this case apart from other cases involving sexual assault allegations that i think should have factored more prominently . "" "" it stands to reason that a person who is ill or in distress is unlikely to consent to sexual activity . "" "" rehtaeh did not consent to being photographed and , in fact , did not know a picture had been taken of her at the time . "" "" legislation has long ago been passed to eradicate the ' twin myths ' about a complainant ’ s credibility and the likelihood of consent based on her prior sexual history . as explained by the supreme court of canada : the main purpose of the legislation is to abolish the old common law rules which permitted evidence of the complainant ’ s sexual conduct which was of little probative value and calculated to mislead the jury . the common law permitted questioning on the prior sexual conduct of a complainant without proof of relevance to a specific issue in the trial . evidence that the complainant had relations with the accused and others was routinely presented ( and accepted by judges and juries ) as tending to make it more likely that the complainant had consented to the alleged assault and as undermining her credibility generally . these inferences were based not on facts , but on the myths that unchaste women were more likely to consent to intercourse and in any event , were less worthy of belief . these twin myths are now discredited . the fact that a woman has had intercourse on other occasions does not in itself increase the logical probability that she consented to intercourse with the accused . nor does it make her a liar . despite this legislation , these as well as other myths and stereotypes about sexual assault complainants still exist in our criminal justice system today . while great strides have been made over the years to eliminate the problem , there is no denying that the system is not perfect . underreporting , undercharging and low conviction rates continue to be a problem . discriminatory beliefs impact each of these steps . as observed by a former supreme court justice , the insidious nature of these beliefs make them difficult to eradicate : ' like most stereotypes , they operate as a way , however flawed , of understanding the world and , like most such constructs , operate at a level of consciousness that makes it difficult to root them out and confront them directly . ' we must nevertheless continue to fight against these stereotypes . the training that has been instituted by police in respect of how a person who has been subjected to trauma might respond to it , is a welcome contribution .

Ex2: i do not know if this question was asked or even answered but why are the media , the left and feminism so afraid of masculinity ? what is wrong with masculinity that everyone seems to demonize it ? like every problem in the world is always linked to masculinity ( in men of course , because when women are masculine they are empowered ) where in the world does this "" mas - scare "" come from ?
Ex3: non - toxic masculinity ? with all the chatter about "" toxic masculinity "" , i am curious . what would non - toxic masculinity look like ? do we need to re - define male and female sex roles ? if so , is there a factual scientific basis that we could use as a guide ? ( it ' s always a good idea to start with the facts ) q1 : are there any mostly masculine qualities that add value to today ' s society ? q2 : are there any mostly feminine qualities that add value to today ' s society ? put another way : are there any biological differences between the sexes that cause some beneficial attributes to be more common in one sex or the other ?
Ex4: is "" incel "" being used as an insult just a pc way to call someone a virgin ? so lately , i have noticed that the label "" incel "" has caught on . with all of the spite people can muster , the second you say something they do not like , you are an incel . it reminds me a lot of how until just a few years ago , you would be called a virgin online regularly . but over time , it became regarded as toxic to judge a man based on his sexual experience . is not incel just the same thing packaged differently ?
Ex5: gillette doubles down on hating all men - removes all downvotes . boycott > downvote go check out the toxic feminazi created ad -       your downvote may be missing . make sure you support alternatives to gillette - dollar shave club for disposable razors feather for safety razors . ( harrys razors seems to have the same anti male strategy . )

------------------------------

Ex1: gender equality survey from my employer i will preface this by saying that they did a good job keeping the questions gender neutral but i had some fun with one question in particular . how would you all approach it ? is there anything else you would like to add , or a specific idea you would like to propose , which in your view would accelerate progress on gender equality in your company ?
Ex2: question : in the battle of gender equality , why is that only masculinity ( literally being male ) is the only thing attacked ? seriously , why is this ? i hear , see it everywhere ! gender equality is cool and all but not the expense of gender over another . so therefore why is masculinity , which form my understanding is what makes us   male   /   men   , the   only   gender identifying behavior being   literally attacked   and demonized ? are there any scientific studies , trials ,   anything   to support the   trash   the world is being bombarded with from hard - left sjws saying that we as men are   inherently   violent or criminal ?
Ex3: double - standards on acting outside gender stereotypes so i just had this thought after seeing this post on [ instagram ] (   god forbid we suggest that women be more brave and ambitious in order to succeed in upper management . that is blaming the victim . but insisting that men be more emotionally open and that it is entirely on them to change is perfectly fine and necessary . feminists are basically re - enforcing the stereotype of masculine bravery and strength by insisting that men use their inner strength to let   themselves cry and show their emotions , and to bravely ignore any backlash they recieve for behaving outside their gender stereotype . i would be interested to hear any similar examples of women not having to radically change their own behaviour .
Ex4: is the idea of gender compatible with feminism or men rights ? i do not really know how to put this problem in words so i will just use examples to the best of my ability . is the idea of gender meant to destroy differences between � � and � � and essentially the same ? if i were to ask someone what a man or a woman is , could they give me a concrete answer ? the reason i say this is because i think the idea of gender is creating more problems then answers . for example , birth control is a women ' s issue because of the fact that women have uteruses . however if a transman has a uterus , than we effectively have a situation that has nullifies the dynamic that birth control is a women ' s issue . i say this because i keep hearing things like you do not need 2 x chromosomes to be a woman , you do not need a vagina , ect . but this seems to defeat the idea of what a woman and man may be , and essentially makes them interchangeable . but this conclusion seems false , take the school system for example , we know that boys do worst than girls in school , the reason being is because boys learn differently than girls . but if boys and girls have no defining characteristics and become interchangeable , than there should be no reason for them to fall behind . this is really rambly and i am open to being wrong , but if anyone can give me a reason as to why gender lead to these conclusions i am open to listen .

------------------------------

Ex1: i am not sure we should see the call to draft women as a true victory for gender equality . i am not sure this should be celebrated as a "" victory "" for equality . to me , the true victory for citizen ' s rights is when there is not a draft to register for at all . just a reminder that our goals are to solve men ' s specific problems , not make things "" as bad "" for women . we want what ' s best for everyone , one reason i always feel the   mrm   is the best moral philosophy i have ever encountered .
Ex2: reminder to my canadian men ! write to your ministers and demand that the income tax act stop discriminating against single father ' s , demand equal rights to claim your children , and equal rights to the   ccb   .   demand the repeal of ""  number  ( f ) where the qualified dependant resides with the dependant ’ s female parent , the parent who primarily fulfils the responsibility for the care and upbringing of the qualified dependant is presumed to be the female parent ""  
Ex3: trying to be equal when job hiring . how ? i was having a discussion with a friend about hiring people at a job interview . the issue : there are two perfectly equal candidates to a job . equal on skill , professionalism , workplace culture fit . one candidate happens to be female , the other male . which one to choose ? my answer was to provide additional interviews and skill based questions as tie breakers . my friend says to automatically hire the female because statistically females have had it harder then men . and that this logic shows equality . looking for thoughts or counters on former / latter or both mindsets .
Ex4: outspoken in sociology class because i supported gender equality someone made the comment : “ the world would be a better place if it were run by women ” i responded it would be better if it were controlled equally by the genders . apparently that ’ s not good enough because men have been running the world for too long and thus we must reverse the inequality . i never thought i ’ d ever need to defend equality publicly .
Ex5: absolutely , there is sexism against women yep . sexist male attitudes against women have meant we have been too easy and soft on them for too long . we have got to stop letting women win arguments , especially about the patriarchy , just because they are women . by not actually challenging them to produce clear evidence and rationale , we have allowed too many of them to develop sloppy thinking ( viewpoints that have not had to stand up to close scrutiny ) . it is deeply unfair of us . it really is a consequence of sexism against women - we should be treating them as equals and helping to stand up against the fanatics in their midst . their woman ' s studies groups - now often rebranded as gender studies - is rife with idealogues who are immune from the robust challenges of serious male - dmoniated academia because few men join them , and when they do , they better tow the line of the echo chamber , or they will learn the depth of "" hell hath no fury .   "" . so , it ' s allowed them to get away with decades of group think , which is now washing over to society in general . one challenge to stand up to now is that of the pay gap and the socialist call for equal outcomes . can not fix one gap without addressing all the others that stand against men . if men were equally likely to win custody battles , there would be more women forced into battling along in their careers to pay child support ( as men have had to do , forcing them to fight for promotions and a raise ) , so correcting one gap would help to correct the other . but can not do this when the toxic feminist narrative is it ' s always the fault of the patriarchy ( actually , it is , since male dominated law set up these systems to benefit women ) and men can never be right and women can never be wrong - their feminist sites are about equality , no matter how many women there are really just bitching about all men ; and our manosphere is always misogyny , no matter how man men like me are just here to raise genuine points . too many men let women get away with this . time to let women know , if they are indeed equal to us , what a true battle of ideologies is like before the extremes of ideology win .

Ex1: just got falsely accused of rape at a family party and physically assaulted . what do i do now ? my best friend now doubts my integrity even though we have been friends since forever . i do not know what the first step to defend myself is . can i get some guidance i am a little shocked right now . the alleged rape happened  number  years ago . i was attacked by the father . i am a canadian national with no criminal record and i have have not had any contact with this girl whatsoever . update : friend just contacted me saying the alleged story had more holes than swiss and that he was sorry for what happened . still looking at legal recourses for the allegations and attack .
Ex2: regret is not rape . ( unless you are a woman ) so a few years ago i briefly dated this girl . i will call her j . during the time we dated she told me about some of her wild teenage antics , including the time she and one of her friends ( they were both  number  ) fucked a local business owner and his wife after smoking a bunch of meth with them . fast forward a few years and now she ' s claiming that she and her friend were raped by this guy and that they were unable to give consent because of their age and the fact that they were on meth . i know legally  number  is a minor , ( in my state ) but these girls knew exactly what they were doing . they decided to trade sex for drugs . because of this whole  hashtag  me too   movement women are doing mental gymnastics in order to jump on this victim train .
Ex3: after seeing how much a false rape accusation ruined my friends life i can not never blindly side with the accusor ever again my friend had been in a toxic relationship with this girl for three years . she was problematic , selfish , childish , and really judgmental of the people he got close to . she had no desire to be better or improve and he finally broke it off with her and moved on with his life . i was so happy for him at the time . i found out later on he was still talking to her all the time and they were still really close despite him supposedly dropping her ass . this led to them having sexual intercourse again a few weeks later which almost led to his downfall . she had a new boyfriend she wasn ' t telling him about and he came across some texts she sent a girlfriend of hers saying that she fucked my friend . to protect herself and with no empathy for how it ' d impact his life she claimed he raped her . her new boyfriend went and blasted him all over social media for this . people he knew for years abandoned him without even hearing his side of the story . i saw him called names i feel no one deserves . he was depressed for months and even tried to off himself . he was only saved because the friend of the girl came out against her after that and showed that she said it was consensual . one little lie could have destroyed everything he was and wanted to be in life . and even though it was debunked people are always going to be more weary around him despite being a truly kind soul . i know it ' s shitty but after that i could never listen to the just the accuser ' s side and decide it was true ever again . when things like this happen i wonder how anyone could but that ' s just the victim culture world we live in .

[ the poison they spread is despicable ] (   and this is only a small portion of the stuff they actually put up . the article itself is inflammatory , and loaded . [ this is the edinburgh university safe space policy as it stands ] (   the main issue i have with this bloody movement is that it is not consistent with real world academia and issues , it ' s intolerant , and fundamentally behaves like it is some self - satirical machine built on a base of misinformation . given the way the world seems to be going , i thought what is currently happening at edinburgh university would be best brought up for the sake of posterity . ' safe spaces ' are so morally and semantically ambiguous , their danger to lead to discrimination can be likened to certain historical examples where with one ' s belief being inconsistent with the values of those in power is met with force of a violent nature . this is pretty emotive and out of proportion , but liberty comes before anyone ' s risk of being offended . the title is sarcastic of course . edit : [ here is the petition ] (   if anyone is interested in it ' s contents .

Ex1: political party in spain tries to abolish the injust law of gender violence . one of the most popular parties right now in spain , ciudadanos , is trying to abolish the law of gender violence , a law that subsituted the law of domestic violence in  number  . this law creates inequality in scenarios of domestic violence as it creates a greater punishment for men because it asumes he abused a position of power in the relationship . ciudadanos has in its electoral program to create a more equal law of domestic violence by which a crime will be punished in the same way wether the perpetrator is a man or a woman . yesterday they defended this proposal in a debate ( albeit the person defending it did not do a good job at it ) and as expected was treated harshly by all the other representatives (  number  more ) . one of them even argued that the law was fair becaused we lived "" in a system of patriarchy , in which there is an opression of the woman by the man . the elections in spain will be the 2 0 th of december and this political party has real possibilities of winning them after the  number  main parties in spain ( pp and   psoe   ) have declined .  
Ex2: have been asked to write an article on domestic violence against men for a high end family law firm . i feel this is a good opportunity for r / mensrights to produce a high quality , well substantiated article to highlight dv against men . the outline of the article will basically be  number  . men are victims of domestic violence  number  . the way we as a society react to dv against men  number  . because of societies attitudes towards men , men are not applying for non - molestations orders in the same number as women any advice , information , sources would be great . nb : the firm is english so uk sources preferable .
Ex3: looking for statistics on domestic violence i am looking for some statistics about domestic violence for a discussion with a feminist . i ` ve seen these studies before but it takes a lot of time to search them up so i thought maybe someone here has them handy . i am looking for metastudies that show women initiate most mutual violence . i am looking for metastudies of dating violence amongst younger people that show women are more often the perpetrators amongst young people .

10,Education,"Ex1: need help with gently   mrm   posters for my heavily feminist school i am the only active   mra   in my school . the feminist club is the biggest club . their leader thinks that the word "" woman "" is sexist . a classmate of mine got accused of "" not believing in rape culture "" . my english teacher encouraged our class to write about how hard it is to be a woman ( in wellington , the sweden of new zealand ) . in order to combat the feminist propaganda around the school , i have started to design some simple posters i can paste around the place . i can not challenge feminism too much yet , as people would pretty quickly shut me down . some of the slogans i have thought of so far are : "" diversity includes diversity of thought . question your beliefs . promote skepticism . you do not have to assimilate . be your own person . do not anybody tell you that you are a bad person for coming to your own conclusions . "" and "" political correctness threatens free society . question your beliefs . promote skepticism . our society encourages a mentality that condemns free thought and speech . you are not a bad person for straying from the status quo . "" i can not think of any more good things to say without being immediately thought of as a misogynist . please help by suggesting ideas for slogans i can use ! context , if it helps - i just finished my first year of high school in the most progressive school in the most progressive city in new zealand , only god damn mra in the country (   corrected   , maybe just my school then ) . * zuni
Ex2: girl in my class said she hates men as a joke takes place in a univeraity in melbourne , australia so i am in class right now and about  number  minutes ago , whilr talking about our favorate writers , a girl said she liked a particular feminist writer because she "" hates men . no , just kidding . "" there was a sortof chuckle from somewhere in the class and the teacher ( female ) sortof hmmed but that was it . i glanced over at the only other guy in the class ( class of about  number  ) and we made eye contact but that was it . the more i sat there though the angrier i got woth the gurl and with myself . i know i ahould have said something or just packed my stuff and left - since in australia this is much less common and accepted than in america i probably would have had a bit of support at least , but i jave missed my moment now . so basically i am looking for any kind of advice for what i can do here . maybe i am overreactig but i have seen on this sub where stuff like this can lead and i am hoping there is some kind of retaliation i can have here . does anyone have any advice i can use ? am i making a mountain out of a molehill ? i just feel so powerless right now about it .   edit   : thanks for all the responses . what got to me rhe most was the complete lack of outrage . just the little support i recieved here has been helpful . thanks to you all .
Ex3: south park has a great example of the double standard towards female teachers who molest students i have become a south park fan , and have started binge watching the show in my free time . today , i saw the episode "" miss teacher bangs a boy "" ( s10e10 ) i was really impressed with how it depicted the double standards surrounding student - teacher relationships . for example : when kyle reports that a teacher is molesting a student to the police they treat it as a serious crime until they find out the teacher is attractive and female , at which point the just ignore it and dismiss kyle .
Ex4: filled with guilt and anger back in first grade , i chased a boy around the playground and he ran away ! i was trying to kiss him ! then in fourth grade , i blurted that i liked him ! now , we ’ re in nineth grade , and we ’ re friendly towards each other , but now that i think about it ! i feel guilt ! i also feel angry because of the fact that a six year old boy was kicked out of school for “ sexual harassment ! ” i wasn ’ t kicked out though ; and i ’ m wondering if it ’ s bexause it happened in a different year , it happened in a different school , or if it was because i ’ m a woman ! what should i do ? !   was what i did in 1 st grade sexual harassment ?

Ex1: is this sexist , or am i crazy ? so i am a phd student and my adviser sends an email saying , "" let us invite  number  -  number  guest speakers , make sure at least  number  are women please "" considering i am in the humanities , it is not hard to find female professors , but should not it not matter the gender of the people we are inviting ? even though i would not really agree with this ( because we should be inviting people based on merit ) , he could have said : "" let us try and invite an equal amount of men to women , "" instead . this is not the first time he has rubbed me wrong in the past  number  weeks . he wrote a few paragraphs imploring us to buy the books ( equaling  money  ) rather than download them for the benefit of the dead / famous scholars . ( i talked to my previous professor about this and she agreed it was not right ) . on top of this , more than half of the students in that class are ma students , who spend  number  - 1 0 0 k a year on tuition depending on if they are international or not ( most are ) , i am over 7 5 k in debt from my ma program . i am not ready to argue with him because our relationship is still new and i do not want to ruin the next  number  -  number  years of my phd , but i am venting here because i cannot stand the blatant sexism camouflaged as diversity . what do you all think , should i say something ? edit : more info
Ex2: title ix reform - ensuring young men can fight back against injustice greetings r / mensrights . i am looking for a few good men to help me in the fight to shape the proposed title ix reform . as you all probably know , the current regulatory agenda for the department of education includes plans for new rule - making ( through "" notice and comment "" ) on what universities can and cannot do to address "" sexual misconduct . "" given the recent - cultural narrative , i will call it - behind the  hashtag  me too   movement , we are at a watershed moment such that the current administration may be the best opportunity we have to combat the dangerous procedural injustices mandated and normalized by the  number  dear colleague letter . that is , we have to act now to protect the due process rights of young men everywhere , and secure equal education opportunities for men and boys . i think we should be constantly writing to the department of education , the office of civil rights , and to our us representatives regarding title ix reform . we must take adjudicative powers out of the hands of university title ix offices , and ensure young men who have been irreversibly harmed by title ix kangaroo courts have avenues to hold universities accountable and appeal / reverse unfair outcomes . i have a pretty decent template for a letter you all could use to write representatives ; i will pastebin it if there is interest . here are some useful links to get started : [ edit ] current information on the proposed rulemaking process :   participate in the notice and comment for title ix reform ( advanced search with department of education ; the comment period should be coming up in march ) :   doe office for civil rights : https :// www2 . ed . gov / about / offices / list / ocr / index . html contact listed on regulatory agenda for this issue : agency contact : alejandro reyes department of education office for civil rights  number  maryland avenue sw . , room 4 e213 washington , dc  number  phone :  phone  e - mail :  email 
Ex3: university implementing tampon fee my university student society of  number  students ,  percent  female , just voted to impose a non opt - outable fee for every student every semester to fund free tampons for students . how is this okay ? they are taxing a minority population on campus to help fund a need of the majority . democracy does not protect minority rights . how can i fight this ?
Ex4: a swedish commission suggests to let women study it with free loans   close to  percent  of swedish it programs on a university level only has  percent  female students , which the digitizing commission finds to be too low . to fix this they have suggested to the government that after women finish their degrees , their student loans should be written off . and their student benefits should be "" reset "" if they were to regret studying it . the chairman of the commission said that it should give the women an opportunity to test the program , without the risk ! per their calculations upwards of  number  women should be able to use these free loans , which would cost between   usd    number  -  number  million , depending on how quickly the goals can be reached . the goal is  percent  women . after this they hope the increase will continue naturally . the current increase is  number  percentage points / year . they claim that  percent  of students of natural science programs in our high schools are women , "" so there ' s an interest "" . well , if there was such a big gap in interests , they would have continued by themselves . i can only speculate that those programs with few female students are games related , or at universities in low density areas .
Ex5: a well written , articulate and persuasive article highlighting the value of ' safe spaces ' at the university of edinburgh after seeing what happened at yale , princeton and other american universities , it really rustles my jimmies to watch my university turn into everything wrong with a liberal society . [ this article ] (   has been run on the localised ' news ' network . i have consistently been caught up in arguments with feminists , and been in trouble with my student union for refusing to [ apologise for comments i made a few weeks ago ] (   after which i joined the liberation society facebook group to see what they were posting . i was attacked for posting my   views , and yet these people get away with the same , if not worse things . [ the poison they spread is despicable ] (   and this is only a small portion of the stuff they actually put up . the article itself is inflammatory , and loaded . [ this is the edinburgh university safe space policy as it stands ] (   the main issue i have with this bloody movement is that it is not consistent with real world academia and issues , it ' s intolerant , and fundamentally behaves like it is some self - satirical machine built on a base of misinformation . given the way the world seems to be going , i thought what is currently happening at edinburgh university would be best brought up for the sake of posterity . ' safe spaces ' are so morally and semantically ambiguous , their danger to lead to discrimination can be likened to certain historical examples where with one ' s belief being inconsistent with the values of those in power is met with force of a violent nature . this is pretty emotive and out of proportion , but liberty comes before anyone ' s risk of being offended . the title is sarcastic of course . edit : [ here is the petition ] (   if anyone is interested in it ' s contents .

Ex1:  just trudeau specifically implies he only wants to help girls education . so justin trudeau has just pledged  number  million to a charity for education . but [ read the article ] (   and you will notice something - he cites that he is donating for "" womens are girls "" education specifically . now the charity called ' education can not wait ' , especially focuses on children in areas affected by conflict or natural disaster , where there is often no   school for any   children so they are not only a charity for girls education , they seek to help [ all   children ] (   so why would trudeau specifically mention women and girls ? is he saying he only wants to them to use that money for girls ? what would that look like ? just not including boys in the programs ? only building girls only schools ? despite the narrative , millions of boys worldwide are also without access to education [ stats ] (   from the un reveal that in many countries around the world , it ' s boys   who are less likely to receive education . and even in a country where the percentage of boys without education is lower , the boys who are   without education still should not be left out . [ at the university level the gap is even wider - men ar a minority of university students in [  number  our of  number  ] (   countries .
Ex2: do many high schools require only boys to pledge not to commit dv ? sadly most boys are not aware of the fact that in   usa   , forced pledges are unconstitutional . even forcing the students to recite the pledge of allegiance is unconstitutional : > west virginia state board of education v . barnette ,  number  u.s.  number  (  number  ) , the u.s. supreme court ruled that a compulsory flag salute would violate students ' first amendment rights > barnette was the first in a series of cases addressing the right not to speak , which prohibits the government from compelling expression in which the speaker does not wish to engage . according to the foundation for individual rights in education > sometimes tyrannical power seeks to force individuals under its sway to speak or utter things that the speaker does not believe . in our moral tradition , that is a frightful assault upon the innermost sanctum of human privacy and dignity . in our legal tradition , it is a worse violation of the first amendment to force someone to say that which he does not believe ( which we might describe as an affirmative form of censorship ) than to prevent him from saying that which he does believe ( which we might describe as a negative form of censorship ) .
Ex3: has anyone tried another wh petition for a council on men and boys ( during the trump admin ) ? simple question . has there been another go at trying to get 1 0 0 k signatures in  number  days on a council for men and boys to complement the wh council on women and girls that was set up under obama ? thanks for any info . i am wondering if we have a chance at it post   trp   .
Ex4: boys to men at my high school there is a mandated course that every male student athlete must do with their coach called boys to men . the course is about respecting women and rape and all that bologna . with all this going on the females do not have to do anything because apparently all women do is get disrespected so they don ’ t have to do anything . absolutely pitiful .
Ex5: sex education for boys . what should it entail ? i think that most people on this sub would agree that we do not give boys anywhere near the same level of comprehensive information about sex , reproduction and relationships in public sex education . obviously we are doing boys a tremendous disservice and , some would argue , setting them up for a whole lot of heartache and often times exploitation . question : what should sex education for boys , whether in private schools , home schooling or public schools entail ?
Ex6: warren ferrell ’ s book “ the boy crisis ” comes out  date  if you haven ’ t heard of this man , you should look him up . he is a shining beacon of rationality . in his upcoming book , he talks about how our educational system is failing boys , and how our nation doesn ’ t care . he was a board member of   now   before they turned crazy , and he picked up on the impending crisis we are facing way before any of us did . i really encourage you all to pre order this book . his work has been really interesting so far !

Ex1: why are our young men killing themselves ? i continually hear about the suicide epidemic among men , yet have never really heard what the cause of it is . while we often do not truely know , ( which is a morbid thought ) i am curious as to what issues people believe to be the main causes of this problem , and why the issue is being continually ignored . you do not have to provide an answer here , per say ( as it is likely very complex ) but if you could point me to another place where a response has been articulated .
Ex2: why is it with the mass media when there ' s a name & face to a suicide .   it ' s always a female ? and the real mindfuck is that statistically men kill themselves at 4 x the rate . i realize we live in a society where females are almost always the victim and the media reinforces this .   but this double standard really irks me . and apparently we men are the ones that are privileged . unreal .

Ex4: australian documentary about male suicide turned into feminist propaganda ? i have been at the last world congress of science and factual producers and while meeting mostly interesting people , one encounter stood out in a bad way . a producer ( woman ) started talking about her last documentary about male suicide , made for australian tv . at first i thought great , somebody talks about men ! well , then i started asking her questions on the subject , causes , and solutions she offered in her program . guess what ' s the cause ? toxic masculinity , of course ! men hold unrealistic expectations of women ! the solution is clearly more feminism and educating men on how to be more "" men "" .   needless to say that meeting destroyed my mood for the night and i left . sadly , without recording her name or the show . more sadly , if i had enough arguments and studies in my head , i would have pushed the issue further as i am ok to confront people with uncomfortable topics . if anyone hear seen the documentary , please write the name in the comments . other than that , lots of feminism and identity politics vibe in the documentary - making world .

Ex2: mother makes obvious attempt to extort money from father . feminist media all to happy to help . when a person wants a  money  and over  percent  increase a month in child support and she most probably makes jack shit , would not the first question you ' d ask be how the hell are you making ends meet right now ? sounds to me she ' s trying to make the case do not look at this . he ' s a shit dad so you should take away his money and give it to me .   msn   just wants to help her out .   the commenters are smarter than the reporter .

Ex4: uk tax disparity . yet the uk government spends about four times as much on women ' s health than men ' s; and eight times as much on research into women ' s cancers as men ' s . in the  number  /  number  tax year , men paid  money  billion of the government ’ s  money  billion income tax receipts (  percent  ) , while women paid  money  billion (  percent  ) . the figures don ’ t add up to exactly  percent  because of some crude rounding in the income tax receipts stats , leading to a discrepancy of  money  million . the bottom line ? in  number  /  number  men paid  money  billion more income tax than women , a new record .

Ex6: burger king ' s "" pink tax fries "" is another example of how one - sided the narrative of gender equality is . so [ this ] (   is a story trending now , burger king launches new fries and has something of a "" promotion "" where they have a special pink box that costs extra . the idea is to raise awareness of the "" pink tax "" , which refers to higher prices for "" womens items "" such as women ' s razors . to me , it ' s so one sided because things like this always ignore the examples where men pay more or are disadvantaged : - men pay more for car insurance , sometimes by hundreds   of dollars - men are the ones who are drafted a die - men receive far less benefit from tax paid programs , services , healthcare , etc but slightly more expensive razors is considered an example of sexism . it may seem like a small thing , but it is a manifestation of the larger general lack of awareness society has for the many double standards against men .

Ex1: just some thoughts i am a male and supporter of egalitarianism and i like most of what i see on this sub . it seems like over here we are a lot more open to dissenting opinions than other subs which i will not bother to name . however sometimes i worry when something here that is an outright attack on women or is clearly false is highly upvoted and very few people call it out . my fear is not that people ' s feelings are going to get hurt , but rather that if we allow people on our sub claiming to be   mra   ' s to say hateful things about women , it will invalidate our movement and will lead to the rest of our good points / arguments / issues being ignored . i think we need to remember we are simply fighting for equality - we must remember we are not a women / feminist hate club . let me know what you think .
Ex2: i talked about men ' s rights on / r / twoxchromosomes . my experience . my post was deleted . you know , i wasn ' t expecting anything else , but goddamn . i mentioned how i was a  number  year old female   mra   , and i got called a liar , whiny redpiller loser . i am gonna take some screenshots and post here . there were some who asked good questions and a really nice person in the comments , but support for my ideas were few and far between . i want to thank all the people on here for being a lot more loving , accepting and rational than any feminist i have ever met . i have not posted here that much but i really love this sub . we got a long fight before we can truly create a marketplace where men ' s human dignity is respected , but the censorship and ridicule i have experienced has made me even more determined .
Ex3: opinion : this sub is turning into r / sjwhate do not get me wrong i have nothing against that sub but i feel that for this sub it should be returned to have a greater focus on men ' s issues , rather than just anything antifeminist . i am not against antifeminism and it is definitely necessary in order to promote equal rights for men but it ' s not the be all and end all of men ' s rights . this may just me being pedantic but i think it makes it harder to claim to be fighting for legitimate issues when it is diluted by pedantic hand wringing .
Ex4: how to combat r / againstmensrights hello everyone , i don ’ t post much ,   mra   lurker here . i like reading this sub and informing myself . the claims that this subreddit is fueled by hate is asinine . it ’ s full of support and care . my question for everyone is how do we combat this and show the world our concerns are genuine and warranted ? people come here , read , and are free to form their own opinions i get that . but aside from the active   mra   commenting on other subs , how can we start more dialogue with feminists ? poking fun or pointing out contradiction from afar is easy ( both us and them ) how do we have more serious dialogue ?

Ex1: men have no reproductive rights . especially not the fellow who got this winner pregnant :   he does not even know . check out the unending support in the comments . especially from those saying "" happened to me .   twice "" . how many of us nearly had children and have absolutely no clue ? ( first post , hope i did it right )
Ex2: a response to the "" my body , my choice "" crowd . i was watching the women ' s march coverage on the news earlier . i heard repeatedly "" my body "" , "" my choice "" and "" my right "" thrown around in some combination with each other . i suggest we add another phrase to this motto . "" my body , my choice , my right , * * my responsibility * * "" if it is indeed   your body   , if it is indeed   your right   , if it is indeed   your choice   , then it certainly should be   your responsibility   .
Ex3: mens abortion rights : why do people think if men got pregnant there would not be a debate there is a post on twoxchromosomes about paying for the pill and abortion rights in general . this one guy posts this . * not sure how hard it is to understand . women ’ s body , women ’ s choice . as a man , if we were the ones that got pregnant there would be free abortion pills at every bar and club . not fair . * for the life of me i simply can not understand how anyone with rational though can think this . after all , if we are in power why have ' we ' chosen not to give ' ourselves ' a single reproductive right . not even one . just a side thought , i guess someday soon there will be a mens pill , and we shall actually see if it is freely available at the local bar or club , hell , i highly doubt it will be covered under basic medical care . in us / canada men do not even have the simplest of reproductive rights , the right to choose to be a parent after we have been raped / sexually assaulted . i mean we do not even get any rights if our sperm is stolen and used to ' father ' a child .
Ex4: men should be allowed to sign away parental rights without the consent of the woman during pregnancy . if she can choose to not be a mother , he should be able to choose to not be a father . here in the   usa   , a woman can have an abortion without the consent or knowledge of the man involved , but men can not choose to sign away rights and responsibility without the woman ' s consent . men should have the same rights as women , just like women should have the same rights as men .

21,Political Issues,"Ex1: an objective book about the suffragettes is there a good and objective book about the suffragettes ? something that wont make them look like the heroes they never were but also not condemn them all together . additional question : what exactly do we know about e . pankhursts understanding of equal rights ? was she really interested in getting the vote for   all   women , or as some have stated , only for women of her own standing , class and upbringing , and not for the chambermaid with a small income ?
Ex2: misandry from donald trump i feel like we have heard a lot from feminists about every arguably misogynist thing donald trump or anyone associated with him has said or done . however , what has not been discussed is his and his associates ' misandrist statements and actions . during the campaign donald said that [ he believes "" women are generally better than men "" ] (   he has also suggested that [ men are prone to rape women if given any opportunity ] (   more recently his lawyer [ said outright ] (   > "" jared is a fine man , you know that , "" the former new york mayor said . "" men are disposable . "" > "" but a fine woman like ivanka ? come on . "" i am sure i could dig around for more and i will at some point but i feel like it ' s pretty clear that contrary to what feminists say donald trump is not representing men or mras in any way and in fact he seems to agree with at least some of the more female supremacist feminists . edit : also wanted to add [ republican and trump ' s attempts to remove men from the welfare system ] (  
Ex3: hillary clinton attacks "" bernie bros "" in new book "" some of his supporters , the so - called bernie bros , took to harassing my supporters online , ” anyone who paid attention at the time knows that the "" bernie bros "" meme was entirely made up . probably by pr hacks working for clinton . it was a lame gamer gate style smear designed to portray hillary ' s opponents as sexist . if anyone was "" harassing "" political opponents it was the paid trolls at "" correct the record "" , hillary ' s online propaganda machine . and what the fuck is it with feminists adding the word "" bro "" to everything they dislike ? bro used to be a term men used to communicate friendship and solidarity . feminists hijacked it and turned it into a pejorative . i also noticed they prefer using the word "" dude "" rather than man . it ' s all so fucking juvenile .
Ex4: after women got the right to vote , why did not they demand the responsibility to be drafted into war ? why did only tens of millions of teenage boys have to die horrible deaths in ww2 ? in korea ? in vietnam ? if i were born in the 1 9 2 0 s i would have gladly given up my right to vote if it meant i could stay home and take care of the kids . it beats getting my legs and arms blown off in combat or being dissected alive in some   pow   camp in a far away jungle . even to this day ,  number  years since universal suffrage it is still only men who are required by law to sign up for the selective service . why have not they demanded equality ? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ""   register   : it ’ s what a man ’ s got to do . it ’ s quick , it ’ s easy , it ’ s the law .

22,Criminal Justice Sytem,"Ex1: court accepts battered woman defense in past relationships in sentence reduction . the guy she tried to kill wasn ' t the person who battered her . in a severe case of   wtf   , women ' s privilege , p*ssy  censored  pass , whatever you ' d like to call it , a woman is charged with first degree attempted murder . she has the charges reduced to first degree assault and then the sentence reduced with the prosecutors tacit approval from over  number  years in prison to  number  year in prison and  number  years probation .   the kicker is the abuse she supposedly suffered was from past relationships . "" they claimed that eaton should be placed on probation because she was amendable to treatment and probation , and she suffered from post traumatic stress disorder (   ptsd   ) from previous relationships . with   ptsd   , the defense said eaton was a “ battered woman ” ""
Ex2:   bbc   tries to disprove fact that  percent  of reported rapes in india are false . cites researcher who found the number closer to  percent  . "" more than one third of the  number  cases involved young people who had engaged in consensual sex outside marriage until their parents found out and used the criminal justice system to end the relationship . "" "" another large category - nearly a quarter of the total - were cases where the man had broken his promise to marry the woman . although this would not be considered rape in many countries "" this is in edition to her either ignoring cases like gupta ' s and the fact the india does not use forensic testing like   dna   , which is by nature exculpatory .  
Ex3: why was brian banks convicted of rape without dna evidence ? why was brian banks convicted of rape without dna evidence ? should not guilt be proven beyond any reasonable doubt in criminal courts ? are the us becoming a banana republic where the rule of law is not applied in such cases ? i find it hard to consider it a racially motivated conviction considering that the accuser was black and the jury was also mostly black if i recall it correctly .  
Ex4: nothing new , just another article calling for separate and more lenient justice system for women . [ here ] (   firstly , non violent crimes like identity theft can do great harm to families - they are not victim - less crimes . and just imagine what happens if half the country knows they can commit tax evasion without any significant penalty , or petty theft . secondly , why should this only apply to women ? if it ' s a bad idea to lock up non - violent offenders , why lock up non - violent offenders who happen to be male ?
